It was almost like he was the power source of the Nautilus, a boiler of barely contained power. I've always imagined Ahab as externalizing his rage, an exploding boiler. Ned Land repeatedly mutinies or tries to escape. Nemo, Bligh, Darth Vader, HAL 2000, The Joker, all the great villains seem to have an underlying vibration, like a bass note just a bit too low to hear, but that can be always felt and triggers the sixth sense of danger in the viewer even when danger is not imminent. Nemo almost always moved slowly, and spoke softly, like HAL 2000. Bligh (Laughton's Bligh) was different. He looked up under his eyebrows, like he didn't trust anything that anyone said."

I'm surprised the writing was nominated for an award, because it was full of tropes. The \"walk inland until someone asks what an oar is\" was old even then, I think. On the other hand, the movie had details that might be overlooked by contemporary set designers and directors, such as towing spars in fog to prevent collisions, and the Russian plane signalling \"V\" for victory by revving his engine in Morse code for \"V.\" ([At 2:04](https://youtu.be/1mx4c0edHiM?si=SVRbTffx4_KthJqp))"

There were so many slave ship mutinies and yet not one of them is a Mutiny on the Bounty (1935). That aside, Amistad (1997) is worth watching just to see Anthony Hopkins do his thing. Hopkins voices a robot in Rebel Moon (2023), and it is the best performance in the movie, among all the human characters."

    "reflection": "The montage style and repeated scenes at the beginning were gripping. This is perhaps my favorite film in this log. The unlikely tangle of hammocks (at 0:02:23) and the worms on the meat leave no doubt as to status of the ratings aboard the Potemkin. While the staircase scene is considered the most notable, I liked the scene with the mutineers covered about to be executed. The reason is that this happened in the real mutiny, but almost surely the canvas was spread on the deck to prevent blood stains. Eisenstein must have appreciated the \"collective\" imagery of the sailors covered as a nameless group under a canvas cover."

In the Caine Mutiny, Keefer gets put down in front of his peers at a party. In the movie Billy Budd, just after the hanging, the crew established control and then fight the French, just as in Damn the Defiant (1962). But Budd was both guilty and innocent at the same time and in the story, redemption is not the crew fighting the French, rather the canonization of Budd. Ustinov was an interesting Royal Navy captain. Often, they are one-dimensional (not Aubry, not Hornblower) like Bligh or Queeg, with little concern for nuanced interpretation of sea law."

The sets are worse than an earlier film Down to the Sea in Ships (1922) and a later film, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (27).

Gene Hackman's Captain Ramsey represents old-school military authority, while Denzel Washington's Lt. Commander Hunter embodies a more global analytical, measured approach to war. This film is like Billy Budd (1962) in that Hunter is both right and wrong at the same time. He mutinies but is also clearly justified in his mutiny. (Of course, Budd did not mutiny.) This film is different from other mutiny films in that the captain takes back his ship by force, something uncommon in mutiny movies. In some movies (e.g., Voyage of the Dammed (1776) and Damn the Defiant (1962)) the mutineers give up the mutiny for a higher cause or after a convincing argument by the captain. Also different in this movie is that Captain Ramsey is generally well liked. The mutiny's underpinning is not a dispute over conditions or treatment of crew, rather the decision to launch nuclear weapons. Thus, it is more like The Caine Mutiny (1954) had Queeg been a little more likeable. However, Queeg was inept and wrong, Ramsey was competent and wrong. So, it seems like being wrong is grounds for mutiny. However, in both films, the abrasiveness of the captains sets the undertone for the mutiny."

Whereas Potemkin ends with unlikely (but plausible, although historically untrue) successful fleet-wide rebellion, Damn the Defiant ends with an absurdity---the mutineers redeeming themselves in a battle with the French Fleet. The British officers and seamen pulled together to defeat a common enemy. That is an interesting parallel, because the real Potemkin mutiny took place during the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese war, and although the Potemkin was off Ukraine at the time of the mutiny, the real crew could have considered the effect of the mutiny on the war effort, as the fictious crew of the Defiant did. In other words, the Potemkin's crew felt the Russian leadership was a worse villain than the Japanese."

    "reflection": "The beginning, with the U-boat appearing out of the green, had a Jaws feel to it. U-96, which had such a pretty shape, was beautiful under water but so awkward on the surface. The claustrophobic interior made it seem like the men were coiled springs, sometimes literally wrapped around each other, ready to violently release at any moment, but for the most part they did not. The captain was filmed looking over his shoulder sometimes, which added to the \"coiled spring\" effect. There was no real mutiny aboard U-96. There were Potemkin-like grumblings about the German military leadership, and the [engineer Johann refused orders during a depth charging](https://youtu.be/qa3jt_GXMts?si=lOdMET9U59qtXInr), but did not try to take over the ship. I think this would be akin to enslaved African, before leaving the coast of Africa, jumping overboard to escape danger. It is not a mutiny in the sense of the Bounty."

It is interesting to compare the production quality of this film with Captain Hornblower (1951) and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003), because there was not a steady improvement over time in production quality. Down to the Sea in Ships (1922; there were movies with the same title in 1936 and 1949) and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003) are both much more realistic that Captain Hornblower (1951). Realism isn't absolutely necessary to make a film work, but it helps. As a kid I was influence by \"The Rope's End\" by Reginald Hegarty, which is a 1914 travelogue of Hegarty's voyage with his family as a boy (about 8 years old) on the whaling bark Alice Knowles out of New Bedford. His father was the captain. It was great to put together Heagerty's descriptions of whaling with actual film."

But it didn't really work out that way. I sympathize with Rediker---he had to make something from nothing, a common occurrence in the sciences when a funded project produces no good results, but a paper must still be published no matter what. Ghosts of Amistad was a good idea, to visit the homeland of the Amistad slaves, which some returned to, and ask the current residents about their memories of the event. However, almost no one had any an oral record of the event. Also, the movie had a very tourist-home-movie feel, much different from Cousteau's The Silent World (1956), which had motion and action. Much of Rediker's film was simply talking heads. I don't think there is an excuse for that, because Ken Burn's Civil War was much the same idea, with lots of interviews, but Burns managed to find tension in his material.",

At one point, aboard the Orca, Brody has a brief, unsuccessful mutiny put down but Quint. That mutiny was based on an external fear of the Shark, as was Johann's in Das Boot (1981) of depth charges. Spielberg makes the Shark something we are interested in, and to make the point simply view Jaws II, which a movie with nothing but jump scares. In that movie, the shark really is just a mechanical device. I'm not alone in having the \"Indianapolis Speech,\" and scar comparison (especially Brody's silence about his scar) as a [favorite clip](https://youtu.be/u9S41Kplsbs?si=hErzmjguJ-gmqODf)."

A good example would be the original Star Trek (1966) series or even The Cruel Sea (1953) in which Lt. Bennett and Captain Ericson are a team throughout the movie. The seagoing cinematography in this film is particularly strong, and it is hard to distinguish between shots filmed on the real ship Rose, the models, the stages, and CGI. For comparison, watch The Sea Wolf (1951) and Moby Dick (2011), the former being among the worst and the latter the best showing real ships sailed on the real ocean. Here is a video on the [filming of Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)](file:///1.%09Master%20and%20Commander/%20The%20Far%20Side%20of%20the%20World%20(2003)) where the production crew explains the challenges of filming at sea, the building of the miniatures (which were huge) and the cast's training program."

This is an experimental historical film, recreating a Middle Passage Voyage with a narrative that could be called a prose poem, and cinematography that could also be called a prose poem. The movie is meditative and haunting. In is biography, director Guy Deslauriers said that slavery was not mentioned during his childhood on Guadalupe and this film is an attempt to account recognize the horrors of the Middle Passage. Rather than using a traditional plot structure, director Guy Deslauriers immerses the viewer in a dreamlike, sensory experience, combining voiceover narration with slightly disorienting close-up shots, disorienting in the sense that the viewer is not given a location from which to view the events. Its slow pace combined with relentless imagery make it feel like waves upon waves of suffering and survival coming from the screen.

In other words, the craftsmanship of the storytelling seems well tuned and better than the other films. Let's get it out in the open now: For Ahabs, prefer Peck to Stewart, and Stewart to Hurt. I actually think Stewart was closer to the \"real\" Ahab, who has moments that seem lucid and moments that seem crazy in the Shakespearean way that Stewart excels at performing. But Peck's Ahab was good for the screen---a simpler character that was easy to understand in movie, more passion and less instability, he's brooding and smouldering, whereas Steward has flashes of lighting. Hurt's performance understated to the point where I would not follow him after the white whale if he asked me to. I did like the way he tied himself to Moby Dick at the end of the film, though."

Patrick Stewart's Ahab is fierce, intelligent, and driven---he doesn't really brood. Ted Levine (the killer in The Silence of the Lambs, 1991) who is a very sound actor plays Starbuck, and, as in the novel, offers a moral---and business---voice amid the madness. However, I imagined Starbuck more like Leo Geen played him, an accountant type, rather than coming across a bit lost and weak, as Levine played the role. Maybe the role should have been played by another actor with Shakespearian experience. [Ralph Fiennes might do](https://youtu.be/v6ji07tsI2M?si=NOc-TJnyA5tDXcJr). Starbuck's role in the movies is less than Ahab's, Ishamel's and Queequeg's, but maybe that is a mistake. Perhaps a larger role for Starbuck would counterpoint Ahab and give Ahab greater dimensionality."

In that book, for me, he convincingly blurred the line between \"exact translation\" and translating the meaning of something. For him the best translation of the poem, \"Le Ton beau de Marot\" was one by his mother, who is not a French reader, but captured the vibe of the poem."

Ethan Hawke brings moral conflict to Starbuck, and is the best Starbuck of the bunch, but Eddie Marsan's Stubb is too serious. This version gives us Ahab's wife, (played by Gillian Anderson) which adds a new domestic dimension, so that Ahab's obsession is not only tragic but personally ruinous to his family. Unfortunately, we don't return to Mrs. Ahab at the end of the movie, for closure. Unlike the raw tones of earlier adaptations, particularly Stewart's (who we call Picard in our house) this version emphasizes psychological nuance and moral ambiguity. This version has the best seagoing footage, being filmed off Halifax on a topsail schooner called Activ."

    "reflection": "I much prefer movies filmed on real ships (e.g., Captain Phillips (2013)). Movies filmed in the 20 years after WWII use real ships and often some of the cast are Navy veterans, so that there is an undercurrent of realism that is missed in movies like Greyhound (2020). For example, Mr. Roberts' cabin door has a panel labelled \"kickout panel.\" Or in Action in the North Atlantic (1943), Near the end of the picture, as the ship is nearing Murmansk, several Russian airplanes fly out to meet it. One of the pilots keeps gunning his engine in short bursts. There are three short bursts followed by a long one. Movie audiences of the 1940s would immediately recognize this as the three dots and a dash of the Morse code \\\"V\\\". \\\"V for Victory\\\" was heavily used as a slogan during World War II."

It's really a classic man v. man, good vs. evil. There is not a lot of nuance compared The Bounty (1984). Who cares? The superb acting is truly a pleasure in and of itself. I could probably be entertained by Clark Gable reading a menu. Later adaptations work through personal backstories or romantic subplots, but this version focuses on leadership, honor, and the collective struggle of a crew pushed to the brink. It has some of the best early ocean cinematography, too."

Or, as Pauline Kael, says, a fop. Trevor Howard's Captain Bligh is more restrained and calculating than Charles Laughton's tyrant, shifting the dynamic from the simple hero-villain to a battle of complex wills. The film expands the role of Tahiti and its people, which is probably a good thing, as there seems little doubt that a desire to return to Tahiti motivated some mutineers. But how tie it all together, the Bligh, the Christian, and the Islands? That is the problem with this movie, it almost seems like a situation where too many cooks spoiled the pot. There were good ideas in the film that failed to form a cohesive story. In the evolution of Mutiny on the Bounty films, as Bligh moved rather nicely from despot to flawed human, Brando's Christian veered off course to be corrected by Gibson, and the complex role of Tahiti and its people probably has never had the treatment it deserves."

The movie focuses on the dynamics between Lt. Bledsoe, the 1^st^ officer, and Richardson, and on Bledsoe eventual command. Similarly, Das Boot (1981) explored personalities, but was less about interpersonal conflict than individual reactions to misguided orders and the pressures of fighting a losing war. In WWII, American subs were larger and more advanced than German U-boats, but the Nerka seemed much less realistic than the gritty U-96. If I had to watch either sub movie today, I would probably pick Das Boot (1981), but there is something about Clark Gable's performance that really mesmerizes me---I think it is the absolute confidence in command that he gives Richardson, like the confidence that actors like Robert Downey Jr. give to their superhero characters. It is also interesting to compare the [depth charged Nerka](https://youtu.be/ruVTaJWQKHM?si=lkUHA5I_UbiCfZsE) to that of [the U-96](https://youtu.be/yD3rKts9v7w?si=_S76K_bT_koYTp0a).

    "reflection": "We lump slave mutinies on slave-ships together as groups of brave and desperate people fighting for not only their freedom but their lives. That lumping is unfair, it is like lumping all the silver-star winners together as having just one war story. The Meermin slaves were, believe it or not, told to clean some Malagasy spears to---and clean them they did with Dutch blood! About half the sixty crew were killed. A surviving VOC (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie) official aboard betrayed the now free Malagasy and continued to South Africa rather than back to Madagascar as promised. As the ship lay a mile off the beach at Struisbaai, about 250 km Southeast of Cape Town, the trapped crew communicated with the VOC magistrate ashore via a message in a bottle that floated in with the tide. Eventually, the mutiny leaders were captured but not executed. They were sent to Robben Island. Meermin's senior officers and the VOC officials were all severely punished. The captain was stripped of rank, forfeited pay, and was forced to work back to Holland as a deckhand. This documentary, regardless of the production quality, which was fine for 2010, importantly told a unique story about a slave-ship route that is less well known in the West than the Middle Passage.

As in Crimson Tide (1995), a few men (a journalist, the ship's doctor, and a former WWII U-boat commander) aboard the Bedford attempt to convince the captain to restrain is actions against a Soviet submarine cruising off Greenland. In many ways, this film is like Crimson Tide (1995), with a demanding but respected captain, who is obsessed with duty, and with subordinates who have a more nuanced view of the situation. What makes The Bedford Incident (1965) different is that for the USS Alabama's Captain Ramsey, his actions are all business and duty, whereas the USS Bedford's Captain Findlander seems to have a personal vendetta against the Soviet submarine. He ramps up his anger and attempts force the sub to the surface for no apparent reason. So, while Ramsey's actions are in a sense rational but zealous and misguided, Finlander's are irrational, endangering the crew, the ship, and the world, the way Ahab's hatred of the whale was irrational and endangered crew, the ship, and the financial success of the voyage. The Irrationality of brinksmanship seems to be a Cold War movie theme. This [trailer](https://youtu.be/uA-rgKBq7Ss?si=mg-vNHWSSBe_HCvw) is not advertising the same movie I watched.

    "reflection": "This film must be watched at least twice, but through no fault of the director. The reason is the switch from Keifer as hero to Keifer as coward is sufficiently masked by appeals to anti-mutiny common sense as to be missing in the first viewing. But even two viewings doesn't change the fact the movie has no heroes. Not even the Caine is the hero, as is U-96 in Das Boot (1981). The Caine Mutiny also suffers the same distraction as the book, which is Keith's love affair, but to a lesser extent than the book. This mutiny is a bit different from other mutinies in that the crew entraps the captain with tricks like passing around helmets at battle station. They push to Queeg to his limits as a leader, something they didn't have to do."

Certainly, the famous scene of the Compass Rose [depth charging a U-boat hiding under floating merchant survivors](https://youtu.be/BajcgNIzMEc?si=lSLZnDjYURMaCXVN) is memorable, but the strength of this movie is its slow boil. The former NY Maritime Waterfront director, Richard Chesebrough, told me about how during is naval service in the Mediterranean the dolphins looked like torpedos and would \"scare the hell out of us.\" That's the kind of tension in this film. It was never boring for me, and only got more interesting, especially since this was not a move about heroes, just volunteer naval officers doing their duty---at the end of the movie the captain remarks to his first officer, \"you didn't finish with a medal, I tried for you.\""

    "reflection": "This good, concise, 30-minute film shows how complicated mutinies can be. This one was a combination of institutional racism, political change (as in Battleship Potemkin), and poor living conditions (as in part of nearly every mutiny). The film uses archival footage and narrations to describe the use of naval power to put down the mutiny, in a movement that contributed to the decolonization of India. The hard-line, knee-jerk reaction of Admiral John Henry Godfrey only fuelled the mutiny. He said, on air, to \"Submit or perish.\" There were thousands of causalities in Bombay. Note that Godfrey may have been the model for James Bond's \"M.\" But the sailors did not have the backing of the government and were forced to surrender. Between 25 and 26 February 1946, the mutineers surrendered with a guarantee from Indian leadership (not British) of no retribution. However, groups of ratings (non-commissioned sailors were called ratings in the British Navy) were arrested and imprisoned. The odd thing about this documentary was the lack of indignation about the racism from the narrators, who appeared to be academics. While the mutineers themselves are either extremely old or dead, their children's generation is still alive, and there must be family narratives that have been passed down but were not included in this film."

They seem to know that Larsen is evil and are on board the Ghost simply from greed. This movie should have won an award, but it did not. Part of the reason may be because the tie-in with Larsen's brother was not clear, the completely unrealistic transfusion scene, and the unrealistic \"water tank\" set. As a side note, there is a review of this version of the film in the March 23, 1941, edition of the New York Times that also summarizes a few of the five (!) versions previous to this one.

I walked right into this movie, ready for hero-worship reinforcement, and was stunned by the sitting on tortoises, the dynamiting of reefs, the killing of a baby sperm whale, and the wanton killing of sharks and other marine life. The upside is to see how far Western countries have come in attitudes about protecting marine life in less than 100 years. I see a lot good-buddy-road-trip documentaries costumed in science or exploration. For example, climber Alex Honnold (known for Free Solo, 2018) climbing with friends while \"investigating\" global warming in Arctic Ascent (2024). The Silent World (1956) felt a little that way, too. Also, it is an interesting title, because underwater isn't so silent."

    "reflection": "Robert Newton as Long John Silver makes the movie. His [eyeballs are remarkably versatile](https://youtu.be/pjShtsEYC4k?si=zsUMQ-M_b-cxpbia), and he can look scary but at the same time indicate that he is also being deceptive. His mutiny is the selfish kind, where, unlike the Amistad, or the Potemkin, there is not a greater good, or even survival involved. There are these spectra of mutinies, which occur for survival, fear, retribution, the greater good, and sometime greed."

    "reflection": "This film is much less scary than Treasure Island (1950). It does have all kinds of strange-looking aliens, but they seem gratuitous, and their morphologies for the most part do not make sense in the context of the film. In the 1950 version, Mr. Arrow is given rum by Long John during a storm and is lost at sea, with, in a sense, no one to blame. In this version, Mr. [Arrow's lifeline is cut by a spider alien](https://youtu.be/3OL3N4oqY7U?si=tCKtTIpADhO-sIG7) and the \"accident\" in blamed on Jim for not checking the lifelines. That is a compelling plot variation, because now we feel Jim is a victim."

    "reflection": "Of course, this film is nothing like Dana's book. However, it has some interesting points. The mutiny involves the ship owner's son and indirectly a female passenger (who is not a captive). It is rare to have females directly involved in mutinies which makes it even more interesting that female-led slave ship mutinies have not been made into film. Captain Thompson was also an interesting character because he had a little backstory, as a disgraced naval officer who still wanted to be in the navy. In most mutiny movies it is simply enough for the captain to be brutal, so this was an interesting feature of the film."

    "reflection": "The director Stuart Rosenberg also directed Cool Hand Luke (1967), which is a much better film. This one tries to tell the stories of many passengers, all at once, and it gets very choppy. Based on true events, the film follows the 1939 voyage of over 900 Jewish passengers of the St. Louis as they desperately seek asylum, only to be turned away by multiple nations. In the movie, once the passengers realize they might be headed back to Germany, they mutiny. The passengers, overall, are relatively well treated aboard, so the need to mutiny comes from fear, as in a slave ship mutiny. Neither enslaved Africans on the Middle Passage, nor the Jews headed back to 1939 Germany, want to go so their primary motivation to mutiny is fear. Of course, the slaves were also brutalized, only adding to the desperation to mutiny. As an aside, Max von Sydow's portrayal of the compassionate Captain Schröder is powerful and contrasts with the ship's political commissar. [The trailer is excellent](https://youtu.be/rJ3aK-ClJn4?si=AIA42iiJZ7oOoBF7). In the trailer, note the phase \"a human cargo,\" when refereeing to the Jewish passengers."

It was almost like he was the power source of the Nautilus, a boiler of barely contained power. I've always imagined Ahab as externalizing his rage, an exploding boiler. Ned Land repeatedly mutinies or tries to escape. Nemo, Bligh, Darth Vader, HAL 2000, The Joker, all the great villains seem to have an underlying vibration, like a bass note just a bit too low to hear, but that can be always felt and triggers the sixth sense of danger in the viewer even when danger is not imminent. Nemo almost always moved slowly, and spoke softly, like HAL 2000. Bligh (Laughton's Bligh) was different. He looked up under his eyebrows, like he didn't trust anything that anyone said."

I'm surprised the writing was nominated for an award, because it was full of tropes. The \"walk inland until someone asks what an oar is\" was old even then, I think. On the other hand, the movie had details that might be overlooked by contemporary set designers and directors, such as towing spars in fog to prevent collisions, and the Russian plane signalling \"V\" for victory by revving his engine in Morse code for \"V.\" ([At 2:04](https://youtu.be/1mx4c0edHiM?si=SVRbTffx4_KthJqp))"

There were so many slave ship mutinies and yet not one of them is a Mutiny on the Bounty (1935). That aside, Amistad (1997) is worth watching just to see Anthony Hopkins do his thing. Hopkins voices a robot in Rebel Moon (2023), and it is the best performance in the movie, among all the human characters."

The unlikely tangle of hammocks (at 0:02:23) and the worms on the meat leave no doubt as to status of the ratings aboard the Potemkin. While the staircase scene is considered the most notable, I liked the scene with the mutineers covered about to be executed. The reason is that this happened in the real mutiny, but almost surely the canvas was spread on the deck to prevent blood stains. Eisenstein must have appreciated the \"collective\" imagery of the sailors covered as a nameless group under a canvas cover."

In the Caine Mutiny, Keefer gets put down in front of his peers at a party. In the movie Billy Budd, just after the hanging, the crew established control and then fight the French, just as in Damn the Defiant (1962). But Budd was both guilty and innocent at the same time and in the story, redemption is not the crew fighting the French, rather the canonization of Budd. Ustinov was an interesting Royal Navy captain. Often, they are one-dimensional (not Aubry, not Hornblower) like Bligh or Queeg, with little concern for nuanced interpretation of sea law."

The sets are worse than an earlier film Down to the Sea in Ships (1922) and a later film, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (27). Gregory Peck fails to capture the subtle insecurities of Hornblower, and the director failed to capture the humorous relationship between Hornblower and his steward.

Gene Hackman's Captain Ramsey represents old-school military authority, while Denzel Washington's Lt. Commander Hunter embodies a more global analytical, measured approach to war. This film is like Billy Budd (1962) in that Hunter is both right and wrong at the same time. He mutinies but is also clearly justified in his mutiny. (Of course, Budd did not mutiny.) This film is different from other mutiny films in that the captain takes back his ship by force, something uncommon in mutiny movies. In some movies (e.g., Voyage of the Dammed (1776) and Damn the Defiant (1962)) the mutineers give up the mutiny for a higher cause or after a convincing argument by the captain. Also different in this movie is that Captain Ramsey is generally well liked. The mutiny's underpinning is not a dispute over conditions or treatment of crew, rather the decision to launch nuclear weapons. Thus, it is more like The Caine Mutiny (1954) had Queeg been a little more likeable. However, Queeg was inept and wrong, Ramsey was competent and wrong. So, it seems like being wrong is grounds for mutiny. However, in both films, the abrasiveness of the captains sets the undertone for the mutiny."

    "reflection": "This film is like Battleship Potemkin (1925) in that the Defiant's mutiny is set in the context of a fleet-wide rebellion. Whereas Potemkin ends with unlikely (but plausible, although historically untrue) successful fleet-wide rebellion, Damn the Defiant ends with an absurdity---the mutineers redeeming themselves in a battle with the French Fleet. The British officers and seamen pulled together to defeat a common enemy. That is an interesting parallel, because the real Potemkin mutiny took place during the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese war, and although the Potemkin was off Ukraine at the time of the mutiny, the real crew could have considered the effect of the mutiny on the war effort, as the fictious crew of the Defiant did. In other words, the Potemkin's crew felt the Russian leadership was a worse villain than the Japanese."

    "reflection": "The beginning, with the U-boat appearing out of the green, had a Jaws feel to it. U-96, which had such a pretty shape, was beautiful under water but so awkward on the surface. The claustrophobic interior made it seem like the men were coiled springs, sometimes literally wrapped around each other, ready to violently release at any moment, but for the most part they did not. The captain was filmed looking over his shoulder sometimes, which added to the \"coiled spring\" effect. There was no real mutiny aboard U-96. There were Potemkin-like grumblings about the German military leadership, and the [engineer Johann refused orders during a depth charging](https://youtu.be/qa3jt_GXMts?si=lOdMET9U59qtXInr), but did not try to take over the ship. I think this would be akin to enslaved African, before leaving the coast of Africa, jumping overboard to escape danger. It is not a mutiny in the sense of the Bounty."

It is interesting to compare the production quality of this film with Captain Hornblower (1951) and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003), because there was not a steady improvement over time in production quality. Down to the Sea in Ships (1922; there were movies with the same title in 1936 and 1949) and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003) are both much more realistic that Captain Hornblower (1951). Realism isn't absolutely necessary to make a film work, but it helps. As a kid I was influence by \"The Rope's End\" by Reginald Hegarty, which is a 1914 travelogue of Hegarty's voyage with his family as a boy (about 8 years old) on the whaling bark Alice Knowles out of New Bedford. His father was the captain. It was great to put together Heagerty's descriptions of whaling with actual film."

But it didn't really work out that way. I sympathize with Rediker---he had to make something from nothing, a common occurrence in the sciences when a funded project produces no good results, but a paper must still be published no matter what. Ghosts of Amistad was a good idea, to visit the homeland of the Amistad slaves, which some returned to, and ask the current residents about their memories of the event. However, almost no one had any an oral record of the event. Also, the movie had a very tourist-home-movie feel, much different from Cousteau's The Silent World (1956), which had motion and action. Much of Rediker's film was simply talking heads. I don't think there is an excuse for that, because Ken Burn's Civil War was much the same idea, with lots of interviews, but Burns managed to find tension in his material."

Spielberg makes the Shark something we are interested in, and to make the point simply view Jaws II, which a movie with nothing but jump scares. In that movie, the shark really is just a mechanical device.

A good example would be the original Star Trek (1966) series or even The Cruel Sea (1953) in which Lt. Bennett and Captain Ericson are a team throughout the movie. The seagoing cinematography in this film is particularly strong, and it is hard to distinguish between shots filmed on the real ship Rose, the models, the stages, and CGI. For comparison, watch The Sea Wolf (1951) and Moby Dick (2011), the former being among the worst and the latter the best showing real ships sailed on the real ocean.

    "reflection": "Most Middle Passage literature (there aren't many movies) comes from accounts by European traders or abolitionist narratives, or databases like SlaveVoyages.org, but Middle Passage (2000) centers on the African experience, reclaiming historical agency through art. The narrative was written by Walter Mosley. This is an experimental historical film, recreating a Middle Passage Voyage with a narrative that could be called a prose poem, and cinematography that could also be called a prose poem. The movie is meditative and haunting. In is biography, director Guy Deslauriers said that slavery was not mentioned during his childhood on Guadalupe and this film is an attempt to account recognize the horrors of the Middle Passage. Rather than using a traditional plot structure, director Guy Deslauriers immerses the viewer in a dreamlike, sensory experience, combining voiceover narration with slightly disorienting close-up shots, disorienting in the sense that the viewer is not given a location from which to view the events. Its slow pace combined with relentless imagery make it feel like waves upon waves of suffering and survival coming from the screen. The film is hard to find on a streaming service, but this is the [trailer](https://youtu.be/3nRgboJR1hs?si=QmDxGF7UB4Qi0AOk)."

In other words, the craftsmanship of the storytelling seems well tuned and better than the other films. Let's get it out in the open now: For Ahabs, prefer Peck to Stewart, and Stewart to Hurt. I actually think Stewart was closer to the \"real\" Ahab, who has moments that seem lucid and moments that seem crazy in the Shakespearean way that Stewart excels at performing. But Peck's Ahab was good for the screen---a simpler character that was easy to understand in movie, more passion and less instability, he's brooding and smouldering, whereas Steward has flashes of lighting. Hurt's performance understated to the point where I would not follow him after the white whale if he asked me to. I did like the way he tied himself to Moby Dick at the end of the film, though."

Patrick Stewart's Ahab is fierce, intelligent, and driven---he doesn't really brood. Ted Levine (the killer in The Silence of the Lambs, 1991) who is a very sound actor plays Starbuck, and, as in the novel, offers a moral---and business---voice amid the madness. However, I imagined Starbuck more like Leo Geen played him, an accountant type, rather than coming across a bit lost and weak, as Levine played the role. Maybe the role should have been played by another actor with Shakespearian experience. [Ralph Fiennes might do](https://youtu.be/v6ji07tsI2M?si=NOc-TJnyA5tDXcJr). Starbuck's role in the movies is less than Ahab's, Ishamel's and Queequeg's, but maybe that is a mistake. Perhaps a larger role for Starbuck would counterpoint Ahab and give Ahab greater dimensionality."

Ethan Hawke brings moral conflict to Starbuck, and is the best Starbuck of the bunch, but Eddie Marsan's Stubb is too serious. This version gives us Ahab's wife, (played by Gillian Anderson) which adds a new domestic dimension, so that Ahab's obsession is not only tragic but personally ruinous to his family. Unfortunately, we don't return to Mrs. Ahab at the end of the movie, for closure. Unlike the raw tones of earlier adaptations, particularly Stewart's (who we call Picard in our house) this version emphasizes psychological nuance and moral ambiguity. This version has the best seagoing footage, being filmed off Halifax on a topsail schooner called Activ."

For example, Mr. Roberts' cabin door has a panel labelled \"kickout panel.\" Or in Action in the North Atlantic (1943), Near the end of the picture, as the ship is nearing Murmansk, several Russian airplanes fly out to meet it. One of the pilots keeps gunning his engine in short bursts. There are three short bursts followed by a long one. Movie audiences of the 1940s would immediately recognize this as the three dots and a dash of the Morse code \\\"V\\\". \\\"V for Victory\\\" was heavily used as a slogan during World War II."

I could probably be entertained by Clark Gable reading a menu. Later adaptations work through personal backstories or romantic subplots, but this version focuses on leadership, honor, and the collective struggle of a crew pushed to the brink. It has some of the best early ocean cinematography, too."

Or, as Pauline Kael, says, a fop. Trevor Howard's Captain Bligh is more restrained and calculating than Charles Laughton's tyrant, shifting the dynamic from the simple hero-villain to a battle of complex wills. The film expands the role of Tahiti and its people, which is probably a good thing, as there seems little doubt that a desire to return to Tahiti motivated some mutineers. But how tie it all together, the Bligh, the Christian, and the Islands? That is the problem with this movie, it almost seems like a situation where too many cooks spoiled the pot. There were good ideas in the film that failed to form a cohesive story. In the evolution of Mutiny on the Bounty films, as Bligh moved rather nicely from despot to flawed human, Brando's Christian veered off course to be corrected by Gibson, and the complex role of Tahiti and its people probably has never had the treatment it deserves."

The movie focuses on the dynamics between Lt. Bledsoe, the 1^st^ officer, and Richardson, and on Bledsoe eventual command. Similarly, Das Boot (1981) explored personalities, but was less about interpersonal conflict than individual reactions to misguided orders and the pressures of fighting a losing war. In WWII, American subs were larger and more advanced than German U-boats, but the Nerka seemed much less realistic than the gritty U-96. If I had to watch either sub movie today, I would probably pick Das Boot (1981), but there is something about Clark Gable's performance that really mesmerizes me---I think it is the absolute confidence in command that he gives Richardson, like the confidence that actors like Robert Downey Jr. give to their superhero characters. It is also interesting to compare the [depth charged Nerka](https://youtu.be/ruVTaJWQKHM?si=lkUHA5I_UbiCfZsE) to that of [the U-96](https://youtu.be/yD3rKts9v7w?si=_S76K_bT_koYTp0a).

That lumping is unfair, it is like lumping all the silver-star winners together as having just one war story. The Meermin slaves were, believe it or not, told to clean some Malagasy spears to---and clean them they did with Dutch blood! About half the sixty crew were killed. A surviving VOC (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie) official aboard betrayed the now free Malagasy and continued to South Africa rather than back to Madagascar as promised. As the ship lay a mile off the beach at Struisbaai, about 250 km Southeast of Cape Town, the trapped crew communicated with the VOC magistrate ashore via a message in a bottle that floated in with the tide. Eventually, the mutiny leaders were captured but not executed. They were sent to Robben Island. Meermin's senior officers and the VOC officials were all severely punished. The captain was stripped of rank, forfeited pay, and was forced to work back to Holland as a deckhand. This documentary, regardless of the production quality, which was fine for 2010, importantly told a unique story about a slave-ship route that is less well known in the West than the Middle Passage.

As in Crimson Tide (1995), a few men (a journalist, the ship's doctor, and a former WWII U-boat commander) aboard the Bedford attempt to convince the captain to restrain is actions against a Soviet submarine cruising off Greenland. In many ways, this film is like Crimson Tide (1995), with a demanding but respected captain, who is obsessed with duty, and with subordinates who have a more nuanced view of the situation. What makes The Bedford Incident (1965) different is that for the USS Alabama's Captain Ramsey, his actions are all business and duty, whereas the USS Bedford's Captain Findlander seems to have a personal vendetta against the Soviet submarine. He ramps up his anger and attempts force the sub to the surface for no apparent reason. So, while Ramsey's actions are in a sense rational but zealous and misguided, Finlander's are irrational, endangering the crew, the ship, and the world, the way Ahab's hatred of the whale was irrational and endangered crew, the ship, and the financial success of the voyage. The Irrationality of brinksmanship seems to be a Cold War movie theme. This [trailer](https://youtu.be/uA-rgKBq7Ss?si=mg-vNHWSSBe_HCvw) is not advertising the same movie I watched. The promotions team at the production company has some real imagination."

Anthony Hopkins gives a sympathetic performance of Bligh---a man more disciplined than despotic---and prone to outbursts ([as in this clip](https://youtu.be/KDc6dZxh0Cs?si=rQ2Vswv7CzMTcX9b)). Mel Gibson's Fletcher Christian is portrayed not as a hero (like Cable) nor a fop (like Brando) but as Bligh's former friend officer cracking under the conflicts of peer pressure (from Adams), a longing for Tahiti, and resentment against Bligh. doubt. This Bounty avoids clear-cut heroes and villains, instead exploring how duty, friendship, culture, weave to together into emotional strain in the isolation of long voyages. The cinematography was lush, and the on-location footage make me understand why Brando lived in Tahiti after filming there."

The reason is the switch from Keifer as hero to Keifer as coward is sufficiently masked by appeals to anti-mutiny common sense as to be missing in the first viewing. But even two viewings doesn't change the fact the movie has no heroes. Not even the Caine is the hero, as is U-96 in Das Boot (1981). The Caine Mutiny also suffers the same distraction as the book, which is Keith's love affair, but to a lesser extent than the book. This mutiny is a bit different from other mutinies in that the crew entraps the captain with tricks like passing around helmets at battle station. They push to Queeg to his limits as a leader, something they didn't have to do."

The former NY Maritime Waterfront director, Richard Chesebrough, told me about how during is naval service in the Mediterranean the dolphins looked like torpedos and would \"scare the hell out of us.\" That's the kind of tension in this film. It was never boring for me, and only got more interesting, especially since this was not a move about heroes, just volunteer naval officers doing their duty---at the end of the movie the captain remarks to his first officer, \"you didn't finish with a medal, I tried for you.\""

    "reflection": "This good, concise, 30-minute film shows how complicated mutinies can be. This one was a combination of institutional racism, political change (as in Battleship Potemkin), and poor living conditions (as in part of nearly every mutiny). The film uses archival footage and narrations to describe the use of naval power to put down the mutiny, in a movement that contributed to the decolonization of India. The hard-line, knee-jerk reaction of Admiral John Henry Godfrey only fuelled the mutiny. He said, on air, to \"Submit or perish.\" There were thousands of causalities in Bombay. Note that Godfrey may have been the model for James Bond's \"M.\" But the sailors did not have the backing of the government and were forced to surrender. Between 25 and 26 February 1946, the mutineers surrendered with a guarantee from Indian leadership (not British) of no retribution. However, groups of ratings (non-commissioned sailors were called ratings in the British Navy) were arrested and imprisoned. The odd thing about this documentary was the lack of indignation about the racism from the narrators, who appeared to be academics. While the mutineers themselves are either extremely old or dead, their children's generation is still alive, and there must be family narratives that have been passed down but were not included in this film."

I walked right into this movie, ready for hero-worship reinforcement, and was stunned by the sitting on tortoises, the dynamiting of reefs, the killing of a baby sperm whale, and the wanton killing of sharks and other marine life. The upside is to see how far Western countries have come in attitudes about protecting marine life in less than 100 years. I see a lot good-buddy-road-trip documentaries costumed in science or exploration. For example, climber Alex Honnold (known for Free Solo, 2018) climbing with friends while \"investigating\" global warming in Arctic Ascent (2024). The Silent World (1956) felt a little that way, too. Also, it is an interesting title, because underwater isn't so silent."

His mutiny is the selfish kind, where, unlike the Amistad, or the Potemkin, there is not a greater good, or even survival involved. There are these spectra of mutinies, which occur for survival, fear, retribution, the greater good, and sometime greed."

In the 1950 version, Mr. Arrow is given rum by Long John during a storm and is lost at sea, with, in a sense, no one to blame. In this version, Mr. [Arrow's lifeline is cut by a spider alien](https://youtu.be/3OL3N4oqY7U?si=tCKtTIpADhO-sIG7) and the \"accident\" in blamed on Jim for not checking the lifelines. That is a compelling plot variation, because now we feel Jim is a victim."

The mutiny involves the ship owner's son and indirectly a female passenger (who is not a captive). It is rare to have females directly involved in mutinies which makes it even more interesting that female-led slave ship mutinies have not been made into film. Captain Thompson was also an interesting character because he had a little backstory, as a disgraced naval officer who still wanted to be in the navy. In most mutiny movies it is simply enough for the captain to be brutal, so this was an interesting feature of the film."

    "reflection": "The director Stuart Rosenberg also directed Cool Hand Luke (1967), which is a much better film. This one tries to tell the stories of many passengers, all at once, and it gets very choppy. Based on true events, the film follows the 1939 voyage of over 900 Jewish passengers of the St. Louis as they desperately seek asylum, only to be turned away by multiple nations. In the movie, once the passengers realize they might be headed back to Germany, they mutiny. The passengers, overall, are relatively well treated aboard, so the need to mutiny comes from fear, as in a slave ship mutiny. Neither enslaved Africans on the Middle Passage, nor the Jews headed back to 1939 Germany, want to go so their primary motivation to mutiny is fear. Of course, the slaves were also brutalized, only adding to the desperation to mutiny. As an aside, Max von Sydow's portrayal of the compassionate Captain Schr\u00f6der is powerful and contrasts with the ship's political commissar. [The trailer is excellent](https://youtu.be/rJ3aK-ClJn4?si=AIA42iiJZ7oOoBF7). In the trailer, note the phase \"a human cargo,\" when refereeing to the Jewish passengers."
