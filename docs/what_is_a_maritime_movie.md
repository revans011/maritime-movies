Maritime refers to the sea, so this catalog is primarily sea movies, rather than water movies in general. I included a few river movies, such as *Apocolypse Now*, *Death on the Nile*, and *African Queen*, because boats or ships (or both) are central to the plot. In a sense, they have important nautical aspect.
In retrospect, Death on the Nile should not be included (but I'll leave it in for now). The reason is that there is really nothing nautical about the movie. On the other hand, *Swiss Family Robinson* takes place almost entirely on land, but is extremely nautical and maritime in nature. It is included in the catalog. One space movie, *Treasure Plant*, was included because it is a "Treasure Island" movie and very nautical.
