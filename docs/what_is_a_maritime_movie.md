Maritime refers to the sea, so this catalog is primarily sea movies, rather than water movies in general. I included a few river movies, such as *Apocolypse Now* (1979), *Death on the Nile* (2022), and *The African Queen* (1951), because boats or ships (or both) are central to the plot. In a sense, they have important nautical aspect.
In retrospect, *Death on the Nile* (2022) probably should not be included, but I'll leave it in for now because I like it. The reason is that there is really nothing nautical about the movie. On the other hand, *Swiss Family Robinson* (1960) takes place almost entirely on land, but is extremely nautical and maritime in nature. It is included in the catalog. One space movie, *Treasure Plant* (2002), was included because it is a "Treasure Island" movie and very nautical.
