EXAMPLE 1

# *Above Us the Waves* (1955)

• Donald Sinden as Lieutenant Tom Corbett

• James Robertson Justice as Admiral Ryder

• Michael Medwin as Sub-Lieutenant Bannister

**Maritime Connections:**

The story of midget 4-person British X-class submarines training and then attacking the *Tirpitz* in a Norwegian fjord in 1943.

**Reflection:**

This film confirmed what I already knew: I'm never, never getting into a midget submarine. I wasn't even comfortable 50 year ago getting into a fake *Nautilus* at the [20,000 Leagues Under the Sea Ride at Disney World](https://youtu.be/UFEVu5jcDqI?si=z3W8YhtZiDUDxQwo). *Above Us the Waves* (1955) tells the story of Operation Source, the somewhat successful British midget submarine attack on the German battleship *Tirpitz*. It was somewhat successful because it crippled the *Tirpitz* for six months, but all the subs were lost and their 4-person crews killed or captured. This movie's attack scenes were terrifying, with one sub trapped under the *Tirpitz* along with the explosives. But I question the ability of any wartime movie to properly capture the intensity of that kind of situation, as the studios like to make stone cold heroes out of the heroes who are just human. Maybe I should not blame the studios, as it is we viewers who like to see heroes as icons.


EXAMPLE 2


# *Action in the North Atlantic* (1943)

Release Date: May 21, 1943

Studio: Warner Bros.

Director: Lloyd Bacon

Lead Actors/Actresses**:**

• Humphrey Bogart as Lieutenant Joe Rossi

• Raymond Massey as Captain Steve Jarvis

• Alan Hale as Boats O'Hara

Awards**:**

• Nominated for **Best Writing (Original Story)** at the Academy Awards

Music**:**

• Composed by Adolph Deutsch

Maritime Connections**:**

A World War II film that follows voyage of a liberty ship as they carry supplies from Halifax to Murmansk while facing attacks from German U-boats and planes.

**Reflection**:

This is a promotional movie trying to show that merchant seamen were just as much "men" as naval seamen, without disparaging naval seamen. The story itself was good, and the early scene with the sinking of the tanker a useful way of bonding the merchant crew who join together for the next trip like a band of brothers. I'm surprised the writing was nominated for an award, because it was full of tropes. The "walk inland until someone asks what an oar is" was old even then, I think. On the other hand, the movie had details that might be overlooked by contemporary set designers and directors, such as towing spars in fog to prevent collisions, and the Russian plane signalling "V" for victory by revving his engine in Morse code for "V."

EXAMPLE 3

# *Amistad* (1997)

**Release Date:** December 10, 1997 (USA)

**Studio:** DreamWorks Pictures

**Director:** Steven Spielberg

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Djimon Hounsou as Cinqué

• Matthew McConaughey as Roger Sherman Baldwin

• Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams

• Recognized for its historical significance and portrayal of the Amistad case

**Music:**

• Composed by John Williams

**Maritime Connections:**

This movie, which is about justice, has its beginnings aboard the slave ship *Amistad*, and flashes back to the ship.

**Reflection:**

This is really a justice film more than a maritime film. For me, it raises the question, why are there few, if any movies focused on describing and understanding the ways enslaved Africans rebelled against their slave-ship captors. There were so many slave ship mutinies and yet not one of them is a *Mutiny on the Bounty* (1935). That aside, *Amistad* (1997) is worth watching just to see Anthony Hopkins do his thing. Hopkins voices a robot in *Rebel Moon* (2023), and it is the best performance in the movie, among all the human characters.
