The maritime movie catalog is a work in progress. For the short term there is a short to-do list of things I, or contributors, need to do.

1. Add movies about the Iberian maritime experience in the New World.
2. Add movies with female protagonists.
3. Create a catagorization system specific to maritime movies. For example, movies are generally classified as "drama" or "action." For Maritime movies, we need something different, like "mutiny," "submarine," "shipwreck," "slavery," or "naval"
4. Tag the AI entries.
