1. I have watched only a fraction of these films. It may be that some are not maritime movies.
2. That said, I used AI to generate "Reflections" as a placeholder for many films. It should be easy to see which ones are AI generated. They are shorter than my entries and less opinionated. For an example of one of my entries, see *Battleship Potemkin* (1925). Tagging the AI entries is on the to-do list.
3. The facts about the movies have not been carefully verified. Use with caution and double check them.
