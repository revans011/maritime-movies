# *Above Us the Waves* (1955)
[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/OibSKE2DjuM?si=UEd41lrGwZyxLm8m)

**Release Date:** December 15, 1955 (UK)

**Studio:** British Film Makers Ltd.

**Director:** Ralph Thomas

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• John Mills as Commander Fraser

• John Gregson as Lieutenant Alec Duffy

• Donald Sinden as Lieutenant Tom Corbett

• James Robertson Justice as Admiral Ryder

• Michael Medwin as Sub-Lieutenant Bannister

• James Kenney as Sub-Lieutenant Gordon

**Awards:**

• None

**Music:**

• Score composed by Arthur Benjamin

**Maritime Connections:**

The story of midget 4-person British X-class submarines training and then attacking the *Tirpitz* in a Norwegian fjord in 1943.

**Reflection:**

This film confirmed what I already knew: I'm never, never getting into a midget submarine. I wasn't even comfortable 50 year ago getting into a fake *Nautilus* at the [20,000 Leagues Under the Sea Ride at Disney World](https://youtu.be/UFEVu5jcDqI?si=z3W8YhtZiDUDxQwo). *Above Us the Waves* (1955) tells the story of Operation Source, the somewhat successful British midget submarine attack on the German battleship *Tirpitz*. It was somewhat successful because it crippled the *Tirpitz* for six months, but all the subs were lost and their 4-person crews killed or captured. This movie's attack scenes were terrifying, with one sub trapped under the *Tirpitz* along with the explosives. But I question the ability of any wartime movie to properly capture the intensity of that kind of situation, as the studios like to make stone cold heroes out of the heroes who are just human. Maybe I should not blame the studios, as it is we viewers who like to see heroes as icons.

# *Action in the North Atlantic* (1943)

Release Date: May 21, 1943

Studio: Warner Bros.

Director: Lloyd Bacon

Lead Actors/Actresses**:**

• Humphrey Bogart as Lieutenant Joe Rossi

• Raymond Massey as Captain Steve Jarvis

• Alan Hale as Boats O'Hara

Awards**:**

• Nominated for **Best Writing (Original Story)** at the Academy Awards

Music**:**

• Composed by Adolph Deutsch

Maritime Connections**:**

A World War II film that follows voyage of a liberty ship as they carry supplies from Halifax to Murmansk while facing attacks from German U-boats and planes.

**Reflection**:

This is a promotional movie trying to show that merchant seamen were just as much "men" as naval seamen, without disparaging naval seamen. The story itself was good, and the early scene with the sinking of the tanker a useful way of bonding the merchant crew who join together for the next trip like a band of brothers. I'm surprised the writing was nominated for an award, because it was full of tropes. The "walk inland until someone asks what an oar is" was old even then, I think. On the other hand, the movie had details that might be overlooked by contemporary set designers and directors, such as towing spars in fog to prevent collisions, and the Russian plane signalling "V" for victory by revving his engine in Morse code for "V."

# *Amistad* (1997)

**Release Date:** December 10, 1997 (USA)

**Studio:** DreamWorks Pictures

**Director:** Steven Spielberg

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Djimon Hounsou as Cinqué

• Matthew McConaughey as Roger Sherman Baldwin

• Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams

• Morgan Freeman as Theodore Joadson

• Nigel Hawthorne as Martin Van Buren

• Stellan Skarsgård as Tappan

**Awards:**

• Nominated for 4 Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actor (Anthony Hopkins), Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, and Best Original Dramatic Score (John Williams)

• Recognized for its historical significance and portrayal of the Amistad case

**Music:**

• Composed by John Williams

**Maritime Connections:**

This movie, which is about justice, has its beginnings aboard the slave ship *Amistad*, and flashes back to the ship.

**Reflection:**

This is really a justice film more than a maritime film. For me, it raises the question, why are there few, if any movies focused on describing and understanding the ways enslaved Africans rebelled against their slave-ship captors. There were so many slave ship mutinies and yet not one of them is a *Mutiny on the Bounty* (1935). That aside, *Amistad* (1997) is worth watching just to see Anthony Hopkins do his thing. Hopkins voices a robot in *Rebel Moon* (2023), and it is the best performance in the movie, among all the human characters.

# *Battleship Potemkin* (1925)
[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/a_bkBbrdyyw?si=Z28AX9zh_6n7oiVy)

**Release Date:** December 21, 1925 (Soviet Union)

**Studio:** Mosfilm

**Director:** Sergei Eisenstein

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Aleksandr Antonov as Grigory Vakulinchuk

• Vladimir Barsky as Commander Golikov

• Grigori Aleksandrov as Lieutenant S. Sergeyev

• Andrei Fajt as Matyushenko

**Awards:**

• In 1958, the film was voted on Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo

• Won the International Prize at the 1926 Venice Film Festival

• Selected for preservation in the National Film Registry for its cultural and historical significance

• Considered a pioneering work in the development of montage theory in cinema

**Music:**

• Original score composed by Edmund Meisel (1925) for the German release, later re-scored for different versions

**Maritime Connections:**

This film is a dramatization of the mutiny aboard the real *Potemkin.* The real mutiny ended less well than the movie, but the mutineers survived in exile in Romania. The mutiny was considered a failure. However, it was a success in the film, as the fleet joined the mutiny at the end of the film.

**Reflection:**

The montage style and repeated scenes at the beginning were gripping. This is perhaps my favorite film in this log. The unlikely tangle of hammocks (at 0:02:23) and the worms on the meat leave no doubt as to status of the ratings aboard the *Potemkin*. While the staircase scene is considered the most notable, I liked the scene with the mutineers covered about to be executed. The reason is that this happened in the real mutiny, but almost surely the canvas was spread on the deck to prevent blood stains. Eisenstein must have appreciated the "collective" imagery of the sailors covered as a nameless group under a canvas cover.

# *The Bedford Incident* (1965)

**Release Date:** October 11, 1965 (USA)

**Studio:** Columbia Pictures

**Director:** James B. Harris

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Richard Widmark as Captain Eric Finlander

• Sidney Poitier as Ben Munceford (journalist)

• Eric Portman as Commodore Wolfgang Schrepke

• James MacArthur as Ensign Ralston

• Martin Balsam as Dr. Chester Potter

• Wally Cox as Seaman Merlin Queffle

• Donald Sutherland (in an early role) as Hospitalman

**Awards:**

• None

**Music:**

• Score composed by Gerard Schurmann

**Maritime Connections:**

The movie takes place aboard the destroyer the USS *Bedford* stationed off the coast of Greenland.

**Reflection:**

The film is a Cold War naval thriller, and a three-way cross between the failure of cold war brinksmanship in *Dr. Strangelove* (1964), the seasoned but driven naval captain in *Crimson Tide* (1995) and hatred of the target in *Moby Dick* (1956). As in *Crimson Tide* (1995), a few men (a journalist, the ship's doctor, and a former WWII U-boat commander) aboard the *Bedford* attempt to convince the captain to restrain is actions against a Soviet submarine cruising off Greenland. In many ways, this film is like *Crimson Tide* (1995), with a demanding but respected captain, who is obsessed with duty, and with subordinates who have a more nuanced view of the situation. What makes *The Bedford Incident* (1965) different is that for the USS *Alabama*'s Captain Ramsey, his actions are all business and duty, whereas the USS *Bedford*'s Captain Findlander seems to have a personal vendetta against the Soviet submarine. He ramps up his anger and attempts force the sub to the surface for no apparent reason. So, while Ramsey's actions are in a sense rational but zealous and misguided, Finlander's are irrational, endangering the crew, the ship, and the world, the way Ahab's hatred of the whale was irrational and endangered crew, the ship, and the financial success of the voyage. The Irrationality of brinksmanship seems to be a Cold War movie theme. This [trailer](https://youtu.be/uA-rgKBq7Ss?si=mg-vNHWSSBe_HCvw) is not advertising the same movie I watched. The promotions team at the production company has some real imagination.

# *Billy Budd* (1962)

**Release Date:** November 12, 1962 (USA)

**Studio:** Allied Artists Pictures Corporation

**Director:** Peter Ustinov

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Terence Stamp as Billy Budd

• Robert Ryan as John Claggart

• Peter Ustinov as Captain Edwin Fairfax Vere

• Melvyn Douglas as The Dansker

• Paul Rogers as Philip Seymour

• John Neville as Julian Radcliffe

• David McCallum as Steven Wyatt

**Awards:**

• Nominated for 1 Academy Award: Best Supporting Actor (Terence Stamp)

• Terence Stamp won the Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer -- Male

**Music:**

• Score composed by Anthony Hopkins (not the actor)

**Maritime Connections:**

The story takes place at sea, aboard *Rights of Man* and *HMS Avenger*

**Reflection:**

As in the *Caine Mutiny*, the wrong man was on trial. There must be something we as Western film watchers like about injustice, followed by some kind of redemption. In the *Caine Mutiny*, Keefer gets put down in front of his peers at a party. In the movie *Billy Budd*, just after the hanging, the crew established control and then fight the French, just as in *Damn the Defiant* (1962). But Budd was both guilty and innocent at the same time and in the story, redemption is not the crew fighting the French, rather the canonization of Budd. Ustinov was an interesting Royal Navy captain. Often, they are one-dimensional (not Aubry, not Hornblower) like Bligh or Queeg, with little concern for nuanced interpretation of sea law.

# *The Bounty* (1984)

**Release Date:** May 4, 1984 (UK); July 1984 (USA)

**Studio:** Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment / Dino De Laurentiis Company

**Director:** Roger Donaldson

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Mel Gibson as Lieutenant Fletcher Christian

• Anthony Hopkins as Captain William Bligh

• Laurence Olivier as Admiral Hood

• Edward Fox as Captain Greetham

• Daniel Day-Lewis as John Fryer

• Liam Neeson as Seaman Charles Churchill

• Bernard Hill as William Cole

**Awards:**

• Nominated for Best Costume Design at the 1985 Academy Awards

**Music:**

• Score composed by Vangelis (known for *Chariots of Fire* and *Blade Runner*)

**Maritime Connections:**

One of the classic maritime stories!

**Reflection:**

*The Bounty* (1984) reexamines the mutiny with greater psychological depth and historical realism than the two previous films, which portray Bligh as a thug, almost a sadist. Anthony Hopkins gives a sympathetic performance of Bligh---a man more disciplined than despotic---and prone to outbursts ([as in this clip](https://youtu.be/KDc6dZxh0Cs?si=rQ2Vswv7CzMTcX9b)). Mel Gibson's Fletcher Christian is portrayed not as a hero (like Cable) nor a fop (like Brando) but as Bligh's former friend officer cracking under the conflicts of peer pressure (from Adams), a longing for Tahiti, and resentment against Bligh. doubt. This *Bounty* avoids clear-cut heroes and villains, instead exploring how duty, friendship, culture, weave to together into emotional strain in the isolation of long voyages. The cinematography was lush, and the on-location footage make me understand why Brando lived in Tahiti after filming there.

# *The Caine Mutiny* (1954)

**Release Date:** June 24, 1954 (USA)

Studio**:** Columbia Pictures

Director: Edward Dmytryk

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Humphrey Bogart as Lieutenant Commander Philip Francis Queeg

• José Ferrer as Lieutenant Barney Greenwald

• Van Johnson as Lieutenant Steve Maryk

• Fred MacMurray as Lieutenant Thomas Keefer

**Awards:**

• Nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Humphrey Bogart), and Best Supporting Actor (Tom Tully)

• Won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor (Tom Tully)

• Inducted into the National Film Registry for its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance

**Music:** Composed by Max Steiner

**Maritime Connections:** A naval courtroom drama based on Herman Wouk's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, However, much of the story takes aboard the *Caine*.

**Reflection**: This film must be watched at least twice, but through no fault of the director. The reason is the switch from Keifer as hero to Keifer as coward is sufficiently masked by appeals to anti-mutiny common sense as to be missing in the first viewing. But even two viewings doesn't change the fact the movie has no heroes. Not even the *Caine* is the hero, as is U-96 in *Das Boot* (1981). The Caine Mutiny also suffers the same distraction as the book, which is Keith's love affair, but to a lesser extent than the book. This mutiny is a bit different from other mutinies in that the crew entraps the captain with tricks like passing around helmets at battle station. They push to Queeg to his limits as a leader, something they didn't have to do.

# *Captain Horatio Hornblower* (1951)

**Release Date:** April 10, 1951 (USA)

**Studio:** Warner Bros.

**Director:** Raoul Walsh

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Gregory Peck as Captain Horatio Hornblower

• Virginia Mayo as Lady Barbara Wellesley

• Robert Beatty as Lt. William Bush

• Terence Morgan as First Lt. Gerard

• James Robertson Justice as Seaman Quist

• Moultrie Kelsall as Polwheal

**Awards:**

• None

**Music:**

• Score composed by Robert Farnon

**Maritime Connections:**

C. S. Forester's naval hero

**Reflection:**

This may be the worst film in my log, even worse than *2010: Moby Dick* (2010). It is really two movies cobbled together. The first part takes place in the Pacific Ocean, and when that is done the second part takes place in the Mediterranean Sea. The sets are worse than an earlier film *Down to the Sea in Ships* (1922) and a later film, *Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World* (27). Gregory Peck fails to capture the subtle insecurities of Hornblower, and the director failed to capture the humorous relationship between Hornblower and his steward. Plus, it seems that nearly every helm order was carried out incorrectly.

# *Crimson Tide* (1995)

**Release Date:** May 12, 1995 (USA)

**Studio:** Hollywood Pictures / Don Simpson-Jerry Bruckheimer Films

**Director:** Tony Scott

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Gene Hackman as Captain Frank Ramsey

• George Dzundza as Chief of the Boat (COB) Walters

• Viggo Mortensen as Lt. Peter Ince

• James Gandolfini as Lt. Bobby Dougherty

• Matt Craven as Lt. Roy Zimmer

**Awards:**

• Won Academy Award for Best Sound Editing

• Nominated for Best Film Editing at the Academy Awards

• Won a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture (Hans Zimmer)

• Recognized as one of the most intense and well-crafted submarine thrillers of all time

**Music:**

• Score composed by Hans Zimmer

**Maritime Connections:**

Most of the movie takes place underwater aboard the fictitious USS *Alabama.*

**Reflection:**

*Crimson Tide* is a thriller about a battle of wills between a sub captain and his XO who have conflicting leadership styles and philosophies of war ([as in this scene](https://youtu.be/hur6LcyuTuU?si=VKvaohdstEs3v9V2)). Gene Hackman's Captain Ramsey represents old-school military authority, while Denzel Washington's Lt. Commander Hunter embodies a more global analytical, measured approach to war. This film is like *Billy Budd* (1962) in that Hunter is both right and wrong at the same time. He mutinies but is also clearly justified in his mutiny. (Of course, Budd did not mutiny.) This film is different from other mutiny films in that the captain takes back his ship by force, something uncommon in mutiny movies. In some movies (e.g., *Voyage of the Dammed* (1776) and *Damn the Defiant* (1962)) the mutineers give up the mutiny for a higher cause or after a convincing argument by the captain. Also different in this movie is that Captain Ramsey is generally well liked. The mutiny's underpinning is not a dispute over conditions or treatment of crew, rather the decision to launch nuclear weapons. Thus, it is more like *The Caine Mutiny* (1954) had Queeg been a little more likeable. However, Queeg was inept and wrong, Ramsey was competent and wrong. So, it seems like being wrong is grounds for mutiny. However, in both films, the abrasiveness of the captains sets the undertone for the mutiny.

# *The Cruel Sea* (1953)

**Release Date:** March 19, 1953 (UK)

**Studio:** Ealing Studios

**Director:** Charles Frend

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Jack Hawkins as Captain Ericson

• Donald Sinden as Sub-Lieutenant Lockhart

• Denholm Elliott as Sub-Lieutenant Morell

• Stanley Baker as Lieutenant Bennett

• Virginia McKenna as Julie Hallam

• John Stratton as Lieutenant Ferraby

**Awards:**

• Nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best British Film

• Jack Hawkins won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor

**Music:**

• Score composed by Alan Rawsthorne

**Maritime Connections:**

Most of the film takes place during convoy protection in the Atlantic Theatre.

**Reflection:**

First, the film's cuts of real ships in heavy seas made me wonder how a sailor could survive a torpedoing in those conditions. Certainly, the famous scene of the *Compass Rose* [depth charging a U-boat hiding under floating merchant survivors](https://youtu.be/BajcgNIzMEc?si=lSLZnDjYURMaCXVN) is memorable, but the strength of this movie is its slow boil. The former NY Maritime Waterfront director, Richard Chesebrough, told me about how during is naval service in the Mediterranean the dolphins looked like torpedos and would "scare the hell out of us." That's the kind of tension in this film. It was never boring for me, and only got more interesting, especially since this was not a move about heroes, just volunteer naval officers doing their duty---at the end of the movie the captain remarks to his first officer, "you didn't finish with a medal, I tried for you."

# **Damn the Defiant* (1962)**

**Release Date:** March 27, 1962 (USA)

**Studio:** Columbia Pictures

**Director:** Lewis Gilbert

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Alec Guinness as Captain Crawford

• Dirk Bogarde as Lieutenant Scott-Padget

• Anthony Quayle as Vizard

• Maurice Denham as Mr. Goss

**Awards:**

• Nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Art Direction (Ted Marshall)

**Music:** Composed by Clifton Parker

**Maritime Connections:**

A historical naval drama set during the Napoleonic Wars.

**Reflection:**

This film is like *Battleship Potemkin* (1925) in that the *Defiant*'s mutiny is set in the context of a fleet-wide rebellion. Whereas *Potemkin* ends with unlikely (but plausible, although historically untrue) successful fleet-wide rebellion, *Damn the Defiant* ends with an absurdity---the mutineers redeeming themselves in a battle with the French Fleet. The British officers and seamen pulled together to defeat a common enemy. That is an interesting parallel, because the real *Potemkin* mutiny took place during the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese war, and although the *Potemkin* was off Ukraine at the time of the mutiny, the real crew could have considered the effect of the mutiny on the war effort, as the fictious crew of the *Defiant* did. In other words, the Potemkin's crew felt the Russian leadership was a worse villain than the Japanese.


# **Das Boot* (1981)**

**Release Date:** September 17, 1981 (West Germany)

**Studio:** Bavaria Film

**Director**: Wolfgang Petersen

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Jürgen Prochnow as Captain-Lieutenant Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock (The Old Man)

• Herbert Grönemeyer as War Correspondent Lt. Werner

• Klaus Wennemann as Chief Engineer (The Chief)

**Awards:**

• Nominated for **6 Academy Awards**, including Best Director (Wolfgang Petersen), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Cinematography

• Won **Best Foreign Language Film** at the BAFTA Awards

• Won **Best Director** and **Best Production Design** at the German Film Awards

**Music:** Composed by Klaus Doldinger

**Maritime Connections:** A gripping and realistic portrayal of life aboard a German U-boat (*U-96*) during World War II, depicting the psychological and physical hardships faced by the crew as they endure the dangers of submarine warfare in the Atlantic Ocean. The film is known for its intense realism, claustrophobic atmosphere, and technical accuracy in depicting the challenges of underwater naval combat.

**Reflection**: The beginning, with the U-boat appearing out of the green, had a *Jaws* feel to it. U-96, which had such a pretty shape, was beautiful under water but so awkward on the surface. The claustrophobic interior made it seem like the men were coiled springs, sometimes literally wrapped around each other, ready to violently release at any moment, but for the most part they did not. The captain was filmed looking over his shoulder sometimes, which added to the "coiled spring" effect. There was no real mutiny aboard U-96. There were *Potemkin*-like grumblings about the German military leadership, and the [engineer Johann refused orders during a depth charging](https://youtu.be/qa3jt_GXMts?si=lOdMET9U59qtXInr), but did not try to take over the ship. I think this would be akin to enslaved African, before leaving the coast of Africa, jumping overboard to escape danger. It is not a mutiny in the sense of the *Bounty.*

# *Down to the Sea in Ships* (1922)
[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/bWs3zGueWDs?si=T8OKv9psYSaZTOhQ)

**Release Date:** September 25, 1922 (USA)

**Studio:** The Whaling Film Corporation

**Director:** Elmer Clifton

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Raymond McKee as Thomas Allan Dexter

• Marguerite Courtot as Patience Morgan

• William Walcott as Charles W. Morgan

• Clara Bow as Dot Morgan

• James Morrison as Samuel Siggs

• Patrick Hartigan as Biff Brown

**Awards:**

• None

**Music:**

• Originally a silent film with live musical accompaniment; later versions feature added scores

**Maritime Connections:**

Great scenes of actual whaling plus a mutiny

**Reflection:**

This silent-era maritime film has a great plot and subplots. It is interesting to compare the production quality of this film with *Captain Hornblower* (1951) and *Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World* (2003), because there was not a steady improvement over time in production quality. *Down to the Sea in Ships* (1922; there were movies with the same title in 1936 and 1949) and *Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World* (2003) are both much more realistic that *Captain Hornblower* (1951). Realism isn't absolutely necessary to make a film work, but it helps. As a kid I was influence by "The Rope's End" by Reginald Hegarty, which is a 1914 travelogue of Hegarty's voyage with his family as a boy (about 8 years old) on the whaling bark *Alice Knowles* out of New Bedford. His father was the captain. It was great to put together Heagerty's descriptions of whaling with actual film.

# *Ghosts of Amistad* (2014)
[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/oUCPo0DSstY?si=ogbfFf_jLW8C_99I)

Release Date: 2014 (USA)

**Studio:** Filmmakers Library / PBS

**Director:** Tony Buba

Lead Figures:

• Marcus Rediker (Historian, Narrator, and Project Leader)

• Saliou Ndjaye (Guide and Translator)

• Various villagers and historians in Sierra Leone

Awards:

• None

Music:

• Traditional African music and oral storytelling featured throughout the documentary

Maritime Connections:

Scholars travel to the home places of returned *Amistad* survivors in search of oral histories.

Reflection:

*The Ghosts of Amistad* (2014) is an attempt for a human look at history, and that the ghosts of the Amistad are living memories that still shape the present. But it didn't really work out that way. I sympathize with Rediker---he had to make something from nothing, a common occurrence in the sciences when a funded project produces no good results, but a paper must still be published no matter what. *Ghosts of Amistad* was a good idea, to visit the homeland of the *Amistad* slaves, which some returned to, and ask the current residents about their memories of the event. However, almost no one had any an oral record of the event. Also, the movie had a very tourist-home-movie feel, much different from Cousteau's *The Silent World* (1956), which had motion and action. Much of Rediker's film was simply talking heads. I don't think there is an excuse for that, because Ken Burn's *Civil War* was much the same idea, with lots of interviews, but Burns managed to find tension in his material.

# *In Which We Serve* (1942)
[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/-sAvT9bf4pE?si=65Kx6KlzegiyRAFP)

**Release Date:** September 17, 1942 (UK)

**Studio:** Two Cities Films

**Directors:** Noël Coward & David Lean

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Noël Coward as Captain E.V. Kinross

• John Mills as Ordinary Seaman Shorty Blake

• Bernard Miles as Chief Petty Officer Hardy

• Celia Johnson as Alix Kinross

• Kay Walsh as Freda Lewis

• Joyce Carey as Kath Hardy

**Awards:**

• Nominated for 2 Academy Awards: Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay (Noël Coward)

• Won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director (Noël Coward & David Lean)

**Music:**

• Score composed by Noël Coward

**Maritime Connections:**

The film is a combination of at-sea shots and flashbacks to the home life of the captain (Noel Coward) and several sailors.

**Reflection:**

Unlike action-driven war films, *In Which We Serve* focuses on the bonds between sailors and their families, emphasizing duty and honor in the face of war's brutality. The movie could have been titled, *This Is Why We Serve*. For an actor of Coward's status, I was surprised at his stiff acting style and the somewhat monotone delivery. Coward's own role in the war was to keep up moral, and he felt that family was key, that servicemen were fighting for their homes, no matter their social status.

# *Jaws* (1975)

**Release Date:** June 20, 1975 (USA)

**Studio:** Universal Pictures

**Director:** Steven Spielberg

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Roy Scheider as Chief Martin Brody

• Robert Shaw as Quint

• Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Hooper

• Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody

**Awards:**

• Won 3 Academy Awards: Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score (John Williams), and Best Sound

• Nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards

• Recognized by the American Film Institute as one of the greatest thrillers of all time

• Inducted into the National Film Registry for its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance

**Music:** Composed by John Williams

**Maritime Connections:**

A shark is a central character.

**Reflection:**

Between the clashes with the Shark, there are conflicts among Hooper, Quint, the Mayor and city selectmen, and Brody. But those are all bread-and-butter conflicts typical for movies. Spielberg (and Scheider) makes Brody complex, by not bragging about his scar aboard the *Orca*. At one point, aboard the *Orca*, Brody has a brief, unsuccessful mutiny put down but Quint. That mutiny was based on an external fear of the Shark, as was Johann's in *Das Boot* (1981) of depth charges. Spielberg makes the Shark something we are interested in, and to make the point simply view *Jaws II*, which a movie with nothing but jump scares. In that movie, the shark really is just a mechanical device. I'm not alone in having the "Indianapolis Speech," and scar comparison (especially Brody's silence about his scar) as a [favorite clip](https://youtu.be/u9S41Kplsbs?si=hErzmjguJ-gmqODf).

# *The Last Push* (2023)
[Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/OJPsBvd5v38?si=hqTdxnqZRpmFChzq)

**Release Date:** January 25, 2023 (India)

**Studio:** Indo-Asian News Service (IANS)

**Director:**

Sujay Bhattacharyya

**Lead Figures:**

• Narrations by experts on the RIN Mutiny

• Voice reproductions of participants

**Awards:**

• None

**Music:**

• None

**Maritime Connections:**

*The Last Push* is a documentary that reconstructs the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny of 1946, when 20,000 sailors took control of 78 ships. The mutiny involved sailors of the Royal Indian Navy who protested against British rule, unfair treatment, and poor living conditions.

**Reflection:**

This good, concise, 30-minute film shows how complicated mutinies can be. This one was a combination of institutional racism, political change (as in *Battleship* *Potemkin*), and poor living conditions (as in part of nearly every mutiny). The film uses archival footage and narrations to describe the use of naval power to put down the mutiny, in a movement that contributed to the decolonization of India. The hard-line, knee-jerk reaction of Admiral John Henry Godfrey only fuelled the mutiny. He said, on air, to "Submit or perish." There were thousands of causalities in Bombay. Note that Godfrey may have been the model for James Bond's "M." But the sailors did not have the backing of the government and were forced to surrender. Between 25 and 26 February 1946, the mutineers surrendered with a guarantee from Indian leadership (not British) of no retribution. However, groups of ratings (non-commissioned sailors were called ratings in the British Navy) were arrested and imprisoned. The odd thing about this documentary was the lack of indignation about the racism from the narrators, who appeared to be academics. While the mutineers themselves are either extremely old or dead, their children's generation is still alive, and there must be family narratives that have been passed down but were not included in this film.

# *Lifeboat* (1944)

**Release Date:** January 12, 1944 (USA)

**Studio:** 20th Century Fox

**Director:** Alfred Hitchcock

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Tallulah Bankhead as Connie Porter

• William Bendix as Gus Smith

• Walter Slezak as Willy

• Mary Anderson as Alice MacKenzie

• John Hodiak as Kovac

• Henry Hull as Charles D. Rittenhouse

• Canada Lee as Joe Spencer

• Hume Cronyn as Stanley 'Sparks' Garrett

• Heather Angel as Mrs. Higgins

**Awards:**

• Nominated for 3 Academy Awards: Best Director (Alfred Hitchcock), Best Story (John Steinbeck), and Best Cinematography (Glen MacWilliams)

• Recognized as one of Hitchcock's most unique and experimental films

• Selected for preservation in the National Film Registry for its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance

**Music:**

• No traditional film score

**Maritime Connections:**

The entire movie takes place in a lifeboat at sea after a ship is torpedoed by a U-boat, which is also sunk. The survivors on the lifeboat are passengers and crew. The members of the lifeboat also rescue the U-boat's captain, and later in the movie, another German sailor.

**Reflection:**

This film stands out for, among other things, the rampant distrust among survivors. In every film screened so far this semester, only this one starts with an almost completely dysfunctional groups of people who, for the most part, do not know each other well if at all. They are not only dysfunctional as sailors (only Willy, the U-boat captain, is knowledgeable) but they their personalities inhibit survival---that's how Willy is able to essential take control of the survivors and the lifeboat. By the end of the movie the survivors pull together as a team.

# *Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World* (2003)

**Music:**

• Score composed by Iva Davies, Christopher Gordon, and Richard Tognetti

• Features classical pieces from Mozart, Bach, and Boccherini

**Maritime Connections:**

British Navy during the Napoleonic era.

**Reflection:**

The best part of Patrick O'Brian's books and the movie is Captain Jack Aubrey's relationship with Dr. Maturin. While conflict, as in *Jaws* (1975), seems to be the cornerstone of tension that drives plots, I like plots with characters that generally get along. A good example would be the original *Star Trek* (1966) series or even *The Cruel Sea* (1953) in which Lt. Bennett and Captain Ericson are a team throughout the movie. The seagoing cinematography in this film is particularly strong, and it is hard to distinguish between shots filmed on the real ship *Rose*, the models, the stages, and CGI. For comparison, watch *The Sea Wolf* (1951) and *Moby Dick* (2011), the former being among the worst and the latter the best showing real ships sailed on the real ocean. Here is a video on the [*filming of *Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World** (2003)](file:///1.%09Master%20and%20Commander/%20The%20Far%20Side%20of%20the%20World%20(2003)) where the production crew explains the challenges of filming at sea, the building of the miniatures (which were huge) and the cast's training program.

# *Middle Passage* (*Le Passage du Milieu*) (2001, U.S. Release)

**Release Date:** 2001 (USA, television premiere on HBO)

**Original Title:** *Le Passage du Milieu* (1999, France)

**Studio:** Cauri Films / HBO (U.S. distribution)

**Director:** Guy Deslauriers

**Lead Actors/Actresses (Voice & Visual):**

• Djimon Hounsou as the Narrator (US version; voiceover for enslaved African)

• A cast of mostly non-speaking actors representing enslaved Africans and crew

**Awards:**

• Screened at Cannes Film Festival (Un Certain Regard, 2000)

**Music:**

• Score composed by Amos Coulanges

**Maritime Connections:**

A description of a Middle Passage Voyage

**Reflection:**

Most Middle Passage literature (there aren't many movies) comes from accounts by European traders or abolitionist narratives, or databases like SlaveVoyages.org, but *Middle Passage* (2000) centers on the African experience, reclaiming historical agency through art. The narrative was written by Walter Mosley. This is an experimental historical film, recreating a Middle Passage Voyage with a narrative that could be called a prose poem, and cinematography that could also be called a prose poem. The movie is meditative and haunting. In is biography, director Guy Deslauriers said that slavery was not mentioned during his childhood on Guadalupe and this film is an attempt to account recognize the horrors of the Middle Passage. Rather than using a traditional plot structure, director Guy Deslauriers immerses the viewer in a dreamlike, sensory experience, combining voiceover narration with slightly disorienting close-up shots, disorienting in the sense that the viewer is not given a location from which to view the events. Its slow pace combined with relentless imagery make it feel like waves upon waves of suffering and survival coming from the screen. The film is hard to find on a streaming service, but this is the [trailer](https://youtu.be/3nRgboJR1hs?si=QmDxGF7UB4Qi0AOk).

# *Moby Dick* (1956)

**Release Date:** June 27, 1956 (USA)

**Studio:** Warner Bros.

**Director:** John Huston

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab

• Richard Basehart as Ishmael

• Leo Genn as Starbuck

• Friedrich von Ledebur as Queequeg

• Harry Andrews as Stubb

• Seamus Kelly as Flask

• Orson Welles as Father Mapple

**Awards:**

• None (But Orson Welles deserves something for his Father Mapple.)

**Music:**

• Score composed by Philip Sainton

**Maritime Connections:**

The story mostly takes place aboard the Whaler *Pequod.*

**Reflection:**

Screenplay by Ray Bradbury and directed by John Huston and it shows. The script and movie flow better than the other *Moby Dick*s. In other words, the craftsmanship of the storytelling seems well tuned and better than the other films. Let's get it out in the open now: For Ahabs, prefer Peck to Stewart, and Stewart to Hurt. I actually think Stewart was closer to the "real" Ahab, who has moments that seem lucid and moments that seem crazy in the Shakespearean way that Stewart excels at performing. But Peck's Ahab was good for the screen---a simpler character that was easy to understand in movie, more passion and less instability, he's brooding and smouldering, whereas Steward has flashes of lighting. Hurt's performance understated to the point where I would not follow him after the white whale if he asked me to. I did like the way he tied himself to Moby Dick at the end of the film, though.

# *Moby Dick* (1998)

**Release Date:** March 15, 1998 (USA, TV miniseries on USA Network)

**Studio:** Hallmark Entertainment / Francis Ford Coppola's American Zoetrope

**Director:** Franc Roddam

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Patrick Stewart as Captain Ahab

• Henry Thomas as Ishmael

• Gregory Peck as Father Mapple

• Ted Levine as Starbuck

• Dominic Purcell as Bulkington

• Hugh Keays-Byrne as Stubb

• Piripi Waretini as Queequeg

• Gregory Peck won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Motion Picture Made for Television

**Music:**

• Score composed by Richard Gibbs

**Maritime Connections:**

The story mostly takes place aboard the Whaler *Pequod.*

**Reflection:**

A made-for-TV miniseries, *Moby Dick (1998)* is more than a retelling of Melville's novel, it serves as both homage and reinterpretation. Patrick Stewart's Ahab is fierce, intelligent, and driven---he doesn't really brood. Ted Levine (the killer in *The Silence of the Lambs*, 1991) who is a very sound actor plays Starbuck, and, as in the novel, offers a moral---and business---voice amid the madness. However, I imagined Starbuck more like Leo Geen played him, an accountant type, rather than coming across a bit lost and weak, as Levine played the role. Maybe the role should have been played by another actor with Shakespearian experience. [Ralph Fiennes might do](https://youtu.be/v6ji07tsI2M?si=NOc-TJnyA5tDXcJr). Starbuck's role in the movies is less than Ahab's, Ishamel's and Queequeg's, but maybe that is a mistake. Perhaps a larger role for Starbuck would counterpoint Ahab and give Ahab greater dimensionality.

# *Moby Dick* (2010)

**Release Date:** November 23, 2010 (USA, television release via The Asylum/Syfy)

**Director:** Trey Stokes

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Barry Bostwick as Captain Ahab

• Michael Teh as Queequeg

**Awards:**

• None

**Music:**

• Score composed by Chris Ridenhour

**Maritime Connections:**

The *Pequod* is a US nuclear submarine

**Reflection:**

Douglas Hoefstader, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1979 for *Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid* also wrote a book about the challenges and meanings of translating literature from one language to another, called *Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language* (1997). In that book, for me, he convincingly blurred the line between "exact translation" and translating the meaning of something. For him the best translation of the poem, "Le Ton beau de Marot" was one by his mother, who is not a French reader, but captured the vibe of the poem.

That's what I think about the B-movie adaptation of [*Moby Dick (2010)*](https://youtu.be/lXSHCzCuKzg?si=EZt_4cI9Ct04k_nt) where Barry Bostwick plays Ahab as a one-legged nuclear submarine captain obsessive in pursuit of a 500-foot prehistoric monster. Stubb is there, as is Flask, Pip, and others. Ishmael is now Michelle, a whale expert. The film replaces philosophical depth with explosive set pieces, poor prop construction, and the worst CGI, but without excuses. Unlike other versions that stay close to the novel's themes of fate and madness, this *Moby Dick* embraces camp, making it less a meditation on man versus nature and more a mash-up of Melville and *Jaws*. It's not high art, but it's high-energy and highly entertaining so long as the nods to Melville's *Moby Dick* are taken as Easter Eggs, rather than philosophy.

# *Moby Dick* (2011)

**Release Date:** November 13, 2011 (USA, TV release)

**Studio:** RHI Entertainment / Sony Pictures Television

**Director:** Mike Barker

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• William Hurt as Captain Ahab

• Ethan Hawke as Starbuck

• Charlie Cox as Ishmael

• Gillian Anderson as Elizabeth Ahab (a character added for this adaptation)

• Eddie Marsan as Stubb

• Raoul Trujillo as Queequeg

**Awards:**

• Nominated for several Gemini Awards (Canada), including Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (William Hurt)

• Praised for its high production values and strong performances, especially William Hurt's more introspective Ahab

• Noted for taking creative liberties while remaining thematically faithful to Melville's novel

**Music:**

• Score composed by Richard G. Mitchell

**Maritime Connections:**

Again with the *Pequod*!

**Reflection:**

William Hurt's Captain Ahab is less manic than earlier portrayals: haunted rather than possessed. Ethan Hawke brings moral conflict to Starbuck, and is the best Starbuck of the bunch, but Eddie Marsan's Stubb is too serious. This version gives us Ahab's wife, (played by Gillian Anderson) which adds a new domestic dimension, so that Ahab's obsession is not only tragic but personally ruinous to his family. Unfortunately, we don't return to Mrs. Ahab at the end of the movie, for closure. Unlike the raw tones of earlier adaptations, particularly Stewart's (who we call Picard in our house) this version emphasizes psychological nuance and moral ambiguity. This version has the best seagoing footage, being filmed off Halifax on a topsail schooner called Activ.

# *Mr. Roberts* (1955)

**Release Date:** July 10, 1955 (USA)

**Studio:** Warner Bros.

**Directors:** John Ford, Mervyn LeRoy, Joshua Logan (uncredited)

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Henry Fonda as Lieutenant (j.g.) Douglas A. "Doug" Roberts

• James Cagney as Captain Morton

• William Powell as Lieutenant "Doc"

• Jack Lemmon as Ensign Frank Pulver

**Awards:**

• Won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (Jack Lemmon)

• Nominated for Best Picture, Best Sound Recording, and Best Screenplay (Adapted) at the Academy Awards

**Music:** Composed by Franz Waxman

**Maritime Connections:**

It takes place mostly aboard the USS *Reluctant*, a U.S. Navy cargo ship during the final months of World War II. Unlike the front-line combat films of the era, *Mr. Roberts* focuses on the routine and camaraderie among the crew members on supply runs in the Pacific Theater.

**Reflection:**

I much prefer movies filmed on real ships (e.g., *Captain Phillips* (2013)). Movies filmed in the 20 years after WWII use real ships and often some of the cast are Navy veterans, so that there is an undercurrent of realism that is missed in movies like *Greyhound* (2020). For example, Mr. Roberts' cabin door has a panel labelled "kickout panel." Or in *Action in the North Atlantic* (1943), Near the end of the picture, as the ship is nearing Murmansk, several Russian airplanes fly out to meet it. One of the pilots keeps gunning his engine in short bursts. There are three short bursts followed by a long one. Movie audiences of the 1940s would immediately recognize this as the three dots and a dash of the Morse code \"V\". \"V for Victory\" was heavily used as a slogan during World War II.

The USS *Reluctant* is a real ship, the 176ft, 705 ton, USS *Hewell* (AG-145), a U.S. Navy Camano-class cargo ship. The USS *Caine* was the USS *Thompson* (DMS-38), a Gleaves-class destroyer that had been converted into a fast minesweeper (DMS). *Mr. Roberts* is a softer version of *The Caine Mutiny* (1954), released only a year earlier. In that movie Captain Queeg is odd, tyrannical, and incompetent. In *Mr. Roberts* (1955), Captain Morton (Cagney) is [odd and tyrannical](https://youtu.be/BIUn_B5s8xk?si=mjtMEsvaCWuT9bwP), but not too incompetent to run a supply ship. Lives are not at stake, as they were aboard the *Caine*. In both movies, the crew provoke and tease their captains with shenanigans, something not seen in movies like *Amistad* or *Battleship Potemkin*.

*Mr. Roberts* (1955) is clearly a John Ford film, with personal character and sacrifice playing a central role, as Mr. Roberts "sticks by his word," and passes by opportunities to keep his word about asking for transfers. Women are only worth looking at.

**Maritime Connections:**

The maritime classic.

**Reflection:**

Charles Laughton's portrayal of Captain Bligh is chillingly authoritarian, a man who rules through fear, while Clark Gable's Fletcher Christian stands as a rugged, passionate symbol of resistance and dignity. It's really a classic man v. man, good vs. evil. There is not a lot of nuance compared *The Bounty* (1984). Who cares? The superb acting is truly a pleasure in and of itself. I could probably be entertained by Clark Gable reading a menu. Later adaptations work through personal backstories or romantic subplots, but this version focuses on leadership, honor, and the collective struggle of a crew pushed to the brink. It has some of the best early ocean cinematography, too.

# *Mutiny on the Bounty* (1962)

**Release Date:** November 8, 1962 (USA)

**Studio:** Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)

**Director:** Lewis Milestone (originally Carol Reed, uncredited)

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Marlon Brando as Fletcher Christian

• Trevor Howard as Captain William Bligh

• Richard Harris as Seaman John Mills

• Hugh Griffith as Alexander Smith

• Tarita Teriipaia as Maimiti

• Percy Herbert as Matthew Quintal

• Gordon Jackson as Edward Young

**Awards:**

• Nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Cinematography

**Music:**

• Score composed by Bronisław Kaper

**Maritime Connections:**

The *Bounty*!

**Reflection:**

Marlon Brando's portrayal of Fletcher Christian is radically different from Clark Gable's. it could be put kindly as a soft-spoken, aristocratic rebel dressed in fancy clothes with a curious accent and growing disrespect for Bligh. Or, as Pauline Kael, says, a fop. Trevor Howard's Captain Bligh is more restrained and calculating than Charles Laughton's tyrant, shifting the dynamic from the simple hero-villain to a battle of complex wills. The film expands the role of Tahiti and its people, which is probably a good thing, as there seems little doubt that a desire to return to Tahiti motivated some mutineers. But how tie it all together, the Bligh, the Christian, and the Islands? That is the problem with this movie, it almost seems like a situation where too many cooks spoiled the pot. There were good ideas in the film that failed to form a cohesive story. In the evolution of Mutiny on the Bounty films, as Bligh moved rather nicely from despot to flawed human, Brando's Christian veered off course to be corrected by Gibson, and the complex role of Tahiti and its people probably has never had the treatment it deserves.

# *Run Silent, Run Deep* (1958)

**Release Date:** March 27, 1958 (USA)

**Studio:** United Artists

**Director:** Robert Wise

**Lead Actors:**

• Clark Gable as Commander "Rich" Richardson

• Burt Lancaster as Lieutenant Jim Bledsoe

• Jack Warden as Yeoman 1st Class Mueller

• Brad Dexter as Cartwright

**Awards:**

• Nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Film from Any Source (1959)

• Recognized as one of the classic submarine war films of Hollywood's Golden Age

**Music:**

• Composed by Franz Waxman

**Maritime Connections:**

Most of the movie is spent aboard the fictional USS *Nerka*

**Reflection:**

Captain Richardson pulls an Ahab---he violates orders to stay away from the Bungo Straits to take revenge on "Bungo Pete," the Japanese captain who sank him on an earlier patrol. The movie focuses on the dynamics between Lt. Bledsoe, the 1^st^ officer, and Richardson, and on Bledsoe eventual command. Similarly, *Das Boot* (1981) explored personalities, but was less about interpersonal conflict than individual reactions to misguided orders and the pressures of fighting a losing war. In WWII, American subs were larger and more advanced than German U-boats, but the *Nerka* seemed much less realistic than the gritty U-96. If I had to watch either sub movie today, I would probably pick *Das Boot* (1981), but there is something about Clark Gable's performance that really mesmerizes me---I think it is the absolute confidence in command that he gives Richardson, like the confidence that actors like Robert Downey Jr. give to their superhero characters. It is also interesting to compare the [depth charged *Nerka*](https://youtu.be/ruVTaJWQKHM?si=lkUHA5I_UbiCfZsE) to that of [the U-96](https://youtu.be/yD3rKts9v7w?si=_S76K_bT_koYTp0a). Fear seems to seep through the hull of the U-96.

# *The Sea Wolf* (1941)

**Release Date:** March 21, 1941 (USA)

**Studio:** Warner Bros.

**Director:** Michael Curtiz

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Edward G. Robinson as Captain Wolf Larsen

• Ida Lupino as Ruth Webster

• John Garfield as George Leach

• Alexander Knox as Humphrey Van Weyden

• Gene Lockhart as Dr. Prescott

• Barry Fitzgerald as Cooky

**Awards:**

• None

**Music:**

• Score composed by Erich Wolfgang Korngold

**Maritime Connections:**

Set aboard the *Ghost.*

**Reflection:**

Larsen is certainly one of the worst captains in cinema, played by one of the best actors. *The Sea Wolf* (1941) sets the bar for mutiny movies with the most despotic captain, one worse than Laughton's Bligh. The crew is not much better. They seem to know that Larsen is evil and are on board the *Ghost* simply from greed. This movie should have won an award, but it did not. Part of the reason may be because the tie-in with Larsen's brother was not clear, the completely unrealistic transfusion scene, and the unrealistic "water tank" set. As a side note, there is a review of this version of the film in the March 23, 1941, edition of the New York Times that also summarizes a few of the five (!) versions previous to this one. There are also several more recent versions too, with [Chuck Connors in 1975](https://youtu.be/87-BHle6YAg?si=JavahVzyXnQDvxbN), [Charles Bronson and Christopher Reeve in 1993](https://youtu.be/MpiawBRBtKU?si=bpvKeVivxWXcPcom) and with [Sebastian Koch, Tim Roth, and Neve Campbell in 2009](https://youtu.be/PCRqH2MNRgw?si=8oxJaCFASobWAP7F).

# *Secrets of the Dead: Slave Ship Mutiny* (2010)

**Release Date:** February 10, 2010 (USA)

**Studio:** PBS

**Director:** Nic Young

**Lead Figures:**

• Narrated by Liev Schreiber

• Featuring historians and researchers such as Professor Stephen Lubkemann

• Archaeological team investigating the *Meermin*

**Awards:**

• Part of the acclaimed *Secrets of the Dead* documentary series

**Music:**

• No attribution

**Maritime Connections:**

This one-hour documentary is a reenactment of the enslaved Malagasy uprising aboard the Dutch East India Company vessel *Meermin* in 1776 as it voyaged from Madagascar to Cape Town, and a reflection on Cape Town's slave history.

**Reflection:**

We lump slave mutinies on slave-ships together as groups of brave and desperate people fighting for not only their freedom but their lives. That lumping is unfair, it is like lumping all the silver-star winners together as having just one war story. The *Meermin* slaves were, believe it or not, told to clean some Malagasy spears to---and clean them they did with Dutch blood! About half the sixty crew were killed. A surviving VOC (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie) official aboard betrayed the now free Malagasy and continued to South Africa rather than back to Madagascar as promised. As the ship lay a mile off the beach at Struisbaai, about 250 km Southeast of Cape Town, the trapped crew communicated with the VOC magistrate ashore via a message in a bottle that floated in with the tide. Eventually, the mutiny leaders were captured but not executed. They were sent to Robben Island. *Meermin*'s senior officers and the VOC officials were all severely punished. The captain was stripped of rank, forfeited pay, and was forced to work back to Holland as a deckhand. This documentary, regardless of the production quality, which was fine for 2010, importantly told a unique story about a slave-ship route that is less well known in the West than the Middle Passage. This film is hard to stream, but here is [the trailer](https://youtu.be/8FU9ZFkweKw?si=FJjOJ24-QXyaWziI).

# *The Silent World* (1956)

**Release Date:** 1956 (France)

**Studio:** Cino del Duca

**Directors:** Jacques-Yves Cousteau & Louis Malle

**Lead Figures:**

• Jacques-Yves Cousteau (Captain and Narrator)

• Frédéric Dumas (Diver)

• The Crew of the *Calypso*

**Awards:**

• Won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival (1956) -- one of the few documentaries to do so

• Won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature (1957)

**Music:**

• Composed by Yves Baudrier

**Maritime Connections:**

Cousteau spend his life at sea developing the aqualung and defending the underwater ocean, and this movie is mostly spent at sea aboard the *Calypso*, with its iconic underwater viewing bulb.

**Reflection:**

The [opening is striking](https://youtu.be/xr4FrELKfvk?si=2Mno4_WSGjICdgs3), with the underwater torches bubbling and sizzling and the scratchy, humming sound of shrimp underwater along with the sound of regulators as recognizable a sound as the pump action of a shotgun. I walked right into this movie, ready for hero-worship reinforcement, and was stunned by the sitting on tortoises, the dynamiting of reefs, the killing of a baby sperm whale, and the wanton killing of sharks and other marine life. The upside is to see how far Western countries have come in attitudes about protecting marine life in less than 100 years. I see a lot good-buddy-road-trip documentaries costumed in science or exploration. For example, climber Alex Honnold (known for *Free Solo*, 2018) climbing with friends while "investigating" global warming in *Arctic Ascent* (2024). *The Silent World* (1956) felt a little that way, too. Also, it is an interesting title, because underwater isn't so silent.

# *Treasure Island* (1950)

Release Date: July 19, 1950

Studio: Walt Disney Productions

Director: Byron Haskin

Lead Actors/Actresses:

-   Bobby Driscoll as Jim Hawkins

-   Robert Newton as Long John Silver

-   Basil Sydney as Captain Smollett

**Awards**:

Won Golden Globe Special Award for Best Juvenile Actor (Bobby Driscoll)

**Music**: Clifton Parker

**Maritime Connection**: Classic pirate adventure involving sea voyages, mutiny, and the search for buried treasure.

**Reflection**:

Robert Newton as Long John Silver makes the movie. His [eyeballs are remarkably versatile](https://youtu.be/pjShtsEYC4k?si=zsUMQ-M_b-cxpbia), and he can look scary but at the same time indicate that he is also being deceptive. His mutiny is the selfish kind, where, unlike the *Amistad*, or the *Potemkin*, there is not a greater good, or even survival involved. There are these spectra of mutinies, which occur for survival, fear, retribution, the greater good, and sometime greed.

# *Treasure Planet* (2002)

**Release Date:** November 27, 2002 (USA)

**Studio:** Walt Disney Pictures

**Directors:** Ron Clements & John Musker

**Lead Voice Actors:**

• Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jim Hawkins

• Brian Murray as John Silver

• Emma Thompson as Captain Amelia

• David Hyde Pierce as Dr. Delbert Doppler

• Martin Short as B.E.N.

• Roscoe Lee Browne as Mr. Arrow

• Laurie Metcalf as Sarah Hawkins

**Awards:**

• Nominated for Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards (2003)

**Music:**

• Score composed by James Newton Howard

• Featured song: *"I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)"* by John Rzeznik

**Maritime Connections:**

It takes place in space, but the spaceships look like sailing ships and the plot is Stevenson's *Treasure Island.*

**Reflection:**

This film is much less scary than *Treasure Island* (1950). It does have all kinds of strange-looking aliens, but they seem gratuitous, and their morphologies for the most part do not make sense in the context of the film. In the 1950 version, Mr. Arrow is given rum by Long John during a storm and is lost at sea, with, in a sense, no one to blame. In this version, Mr. [Arrow's lifeline is cut by a spider alien](https://youtu.be/3OL3N4oqY7U?si=tCKtTIpADhO-sIG7) and the "accident" in blamed on Jim for not checking the lifelines. That is a compelling plot variation, because now we feel Jim is a victim.

# *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* (1954)

**Release Date**: December 23, 1954

**Studio**: Walt Disney Productions

**Director**: Richard Fleischer

**Lead Actors/Actresses**:

-   Kirk Douglas as Ned Land

-   James Mason as Captain Nemo

-   Paul Lukas as Professor Aronnax

**Awards**: Won 2 Academy Awards: Best Art Direction, Best Special Effects

**Music**: Paul J. Smith

**Maritime Connections**: Adaptation of Jules Verne's novel, following the adventures of Captain Nemo aboard the submarine Nautilus.

**Reflection**: Nemo has been compared to Ahab, but James Mason put Nemo's rage on the inside, making the character powerful but brittle at the same time. It was almost like he was the power source of the Nautilus, a boiler of barely contained power. I've always imagined Ahab as externalizing his rage, an exploding boiler. Ned Land repeatedly mutinies or tries to escape. Nemo, Bligh, Darth Vader, HAL 2000, The Joker, all the great villains seem to have an underlying vibration, like a bass note just a bit too low to hear, but that can be always felt and triggers the sixth sense of danger in the viewer even when danger is not imminent. Nemo almost always moved slowly, and spoke softly, like HAL 2000. Bligh (Laughton's Bligh) was different. He looked up under his eyebrows, like he didn't trust anything that anyone said.

# *Two Years Before the Mast* (1946)

**Release Date:** November 22, 1946 (USA)

**Studio:** Paramount Pictures

**Director:** John Farrow

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Alan Ladd as Charles Stewart

• Brian Donlevy as Richard Henry Dana Jr.

• William Bendix as Amazeen

• Barry Fitzgerald as Terence O'Feeney

• Howard Da Silva as Mr. Brown

• Albert Dekker as Capt. Francis A. Thompson

• Esther Fernández as Maria

**Awards:**

• None

**Music:**

• Composed by Victor Young

**Maritime Connections:**

The movie takes place almost entirely at sea, aboard the *Pilgrim*

**Reflection:**

Of course, this film is nothing like Dana's book. However, it has some interesting points. The mutiny involves the ship owner's son and indirectly a female passenger (who is not a captive). It is rare to have females directly involved in mutinies which makes it even more interesting that female-led slave ship mutinies have not been made into film. Captain Thompson was also an interesting character because he had a little backstory, as a disgraced naval officer who still wanted to be in the navy. In most mutiny movies it is simply enough for the captain to be brutal, so this was an interesting feature of the film.

# *Voyage of the Damned* (1976)

**Release Date:** December 22, 1976 (USA)

**Studio:** ITC Entertainment

**Director:** Stuart Rosenberg

**Lead Actors/Actresses:**

• Faye Dunaway as Denise Kreisler

• Oskar Werner as Professor Egon Kreisler

• Max von Sydow as Captain Gustav Schröder

• Malcolm McDowell as Max Gunter

• Orson Welles as José Estedes

• James Mason as Admiral Wilhelm Canaris

• Ben Gazzara as Morris Troper

**Awards:**

• Nominated for 3 Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actress (Lee Grant), Best Original Score, and Best Adapted Screenplay

• Won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress (Lee Grant)

**Music:** Score composed by Lalo Schifrin

**Maritime Connections:**

It takes place primarily aboard the *St. Louis*, and is a historical drama based on real events.

**Reflection:**

The director Stuart Rosenberg also directed *Cool Hand* Luke (1967), which is a much better film. This one tries to tell the stories of many passengers, all at once, and it gets very choppy. Based on true events, the film follows the 1939 voyage of over 900 Jewish passengers of the *St. Louis* as they desperately seek asylum, only to be turned away by multiple nations. In the movie, once the passengers realize they might be headed back to Germany, they mutiny. The passengers, overall, are relatively well treated aboard, so the need to mutiny comes from fear, as in a slave ship mutiny. Neither enslaved Africans on the Middle Passage, nor the Jews headed back to 1939 Germany, want to go so their primary motivation to mutiny is fear. Of course, the slaves were also brutalized, only adding to the desperation to mutiny. As an aside, Max von Sydow's portrayal of the compassionate Captain Schröder is powerful and contrasts with the ship's political commissar. [The trailer is excellent](https://youtu.be/rJ3aK-ClJn4?si=AIA42iiJZ7oOoBF7). In the trailer, note the phase "a human cargo," when refereeing to the Jewish passengers.

**Awards:**  
- None noted  

**Music:**  
- Score by Mischa Bakaleinikoff (uncredited music director)  

**Maritime Connections:**  
A Royal Navy drama set during the Napoleonic Wars, centered on a harsh captain whose command style sparks mutiny fears. Heavy use of shipboard scenes and naval customs.  

**Reflection:**  
Though modest in production, it’s an early postwar depiction of authoritarian naval leadership. Its framing of discipline versus morale resonates in other maritime films like *The Caine Mutiny* (1954).

**Maritime Connections:**  
Chronicles the real-life Royal Navy operation to destroy the German battleship *Bismarck*. Features strategy rooms and scenes aboard destroyers and carriers.  

**Reflection:**  
A tightly paced naval thriller, its documentary style adds tension. It captures both tactical command and sailors’ fear. For WWII naval history, this is foundational cinema.

# *The Battle of the River Plate* (1956)

**Release Date:** October 30, 1956 (UK)  
**Studio:** The Rank Organisation  
**Director:** Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger

- BAFTA nomination for Best British Screenplay  

**Music:**  
- Score by Brian Easdale  

**Maritime Connections:**  
Depicts the 1939 naval battle between the German cruiser *Admiral Graf Spee* and British forces. Shot with real warships, adding realism.  

**Reflection:**  
An unusual war film—more about honor than violence. Captain Langsdorff is portrayed with moral complexity. For naval buffs, this film feels like a respectful reenactment.

- Nominated for Best Special Visual Effects (BAFTA)  

**Music:**  
- Composed by Roque Baños  

**Maritime Connections:**  
Based on the 1820 tragedy of the whaleship *Essex*, which inspired *Moby-Dick*. Extensive whaling scenes, storms, and shipwreck survival.  

**Reflection:**  
A grim reminder of the brutality of whaling and the ocean’s indifference. The movie doesn’t flinch from starvation, desperation, or cannibalism. A darker take on seafaring lore.

**Music:**  
- Score by Christopher Drake  

**Maritime Connections:**  
Set aboard a crabbing vessel in the Bering Sea where the crew recovers a Soviet spacecraft containing alien life.  

**Reflection:**  
Essentially *The Thing* at sea, with throwback practical monster effects. Its isolated maritime setting amplifies the horror. Cold, claustrophobic, and gooey.

**Music:**  
- Composed by Michael Lira  

**Maritime Connections:**  
Survivors from a torpedoed WWII ship find refuge on an abandoned Nazi vessel—haunted by vampiric horrors.  

**Reflection:**  
A fascinating genre blend: U-boat thriller meets gothic horror. Ship corridors and creaking hulls build dread. Strange, stylish, and very wet.

**Music:**  
- Score by Jerry Goldsmith  

**Maritime Connections:**  
Underwater mining crew encounters a parasitic mutation on a sunken Soviet ship.  

**Reflection:**  
Clearly riding the coattails of *The Abyss* and *Alien*, but it has its charms. Confined submarine spaces make the horror plausible. The corporate greed subplot still resonates.

**Music:**  
- Synth-heavy score by Sam Benjafield  

**Maritime Connections:**  
A deep-sea crew investigating a sunken facility awakens a Lovecraftian sea god.  

**Reflection:**  
A pulpy homage to ’70s and ’80s aquatic horror. Campy, murky, and oddly committed to its cosmic themes. It’s like *The Beyond* with SCUBA tanks.

- Score by Bronisław Kaper  

**Maritime Connections:**  
Adapted from Joseph Conrad’s novel about a disgraced ship officer seeking redemption in Southeast Asia.  

**Reflection:**  
O’Toole brings tragic gravitas to the title role. The ship desertion scene is unforgettable. A film that grapples with guilt and the ethics of command.

**Awards:**  
- None  

**Music:**  
- Score by Alan Parker  

**Maritime Connections:**  
Fictionalized retelling of the sinking of *HMHS Britannic*, sister ship to *Titanic*. Involves espionage and sabotage aboard the vessel.  

**Reflection:**  
Leans into spy-thriller territory but makes excellent use of maritime set pieces. Less melodramatic than *Titanic* (1997), but still visually gripping.

- Score by Basil Poledouris  

**Maritime Connections:**  
A Soviet nuclear sub captain defects, pursued across the Atlantic. Set entirely in submarines and naval command centers.  

**Reflection:**  
One of the best Cold War thrillers. Submarine tension is amplified by clever sound design and tight dialogue. Connery commands the screen (and the Red October).

- Score by John Barry  

**Maritime Connections:**  
Divers off Bermuda find World War II treasure and drugs, attracting smugglers. Underwater diving sequences feature heavily.  

**Reflection:**  
Aesthetically lush and moody. Bisset’s diving scenes made headlines. Suspenseful and sensual, though it never quite reaches *Jaws* territory.

# [*Close Quarters*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0221880/) (1943)

**Release Date:** 1943 (produced and released by the Crown Film Unit during World War II)  
**Studio:** Crown Film Unit, produced for the Ministry of Information (sponsored by Admiralty)  
**Director:** [Jack Lee](https://www.imdb.com/find/?q=Jack%20Lee)  

**Lead Actors:**  
- [Lieutenant Commander Gregory](https://www.imdb.com/find/?q=Lieutenant%20Commander%20Gregory) (portraying himself)  
- Real crew and officers of the Royal Navy submarine (uncredited)

**Awards:**  
- No records of major awards found; this is a wartime documentary-style production with no documented awards.

**Music:**  
- Composed by [Gordon Jacob](https://www.imdb.com/find/?q=Gordon%20Jacob)

**Maritime Connections:**  
Focuses on a Royal Navy T-class submarine (HMS Tyrant) operating in the North Sea off Norway. It follows a realistic portrayal of a routine patrol—covering torpedoing enemy vessels, encounters with U-boats, rescue of Norwegian sailors, depth-charging sequences, and submarine damage control. Interiors were filmed both aboard real vessels and in full-scale models at Pinewood Studios.

**Reflection:**  
Close Quarters immerses viewers in the stark realities of underwater wartime operations, using authentic settings and real navy personnel to emphasize procedure, hierarchy, and the psychological tension of submerged naval warfare. The absence of professional actors enhances its documentary feel, reinforcing the maritime environment—not just as backdrop but as the crucible of drama. The deliberate, realistic pacing and use of genuine naval routine make suspense arise naturally from operational challenges rather than sensational plot.
